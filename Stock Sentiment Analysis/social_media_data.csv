Reddit,AAPL,"{'title': 'Trading Tactics: Wall Street Bets (WSB), Herd Mentality, Float & My Single Greatest Trade', 'content': 'You can\'t be in the markets and not know the now infamous Wall Street Bets subreddit in all its glory. In fact, it even has its own movie: Dumb Money. Being honest, it was a fun watch while on a flight.\n\nThe interesting thing about WSB is that it\'s not a new concept, but one that gained popularity because of the popularity of the Internet, Reddit and herd mentality in equal parts to create something that wasn\'t possible ""back in the day."" In 1998 I was part of a similar group, but without the wide appeal because we didn\'t have Reddit back then. We had a site by the name Silicon Investor, where I would eventually start my own stock thread. Similar to Roaring Kitty, ""Tokyo Joe"" started a thread called ""Society Anonyme"" and it quickly became a popular site for high volatility stock trading, discussion and basically the same thing that WSB is today. In fact, while the last post to that thread occurred in 2008, you can still see the subject and its history here:\n\n[https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=21973](https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=21973)\n\nTokyo Joe would eventually face charges surrounding stock manipulation, etc. It truly is a very similar story to that of WSB. I was a frequent poster on his board and many private conversations with him back in the day before I started seeing the true nature of what was going on.\n\nThe key point here is that herd mentality has always been a part of stock trading and markets. Whether in the short term, or the long term, it\'s a pure supply-demand scenario. The primary difference between then and now is the size of the herd, and it\'s a sizable difference. Add in the ability for electronic, algo-driven, high frequency trading on exchanges and you have the ability to move a lot of shares very quickly, potentially \'manipulating\' a stock. Again, it\'s supply and demand in its purest form.\n\nAll stocks have something you should pay attention to:  Float. This is the number of shares available for public trading. Some stocks may have a float of only a few million (or less) while others like $NVDA, could have in the double digit billions. This is where supply and demand economics plays out.\n\nIf you go to the store to purchase lemons and the store has 1,000 lemons in the bin, buying a few lemons will not impact the price. The store may only sell 300 lemons per day and get 300 lemons in shipment the next day to replace the supply. As long as demand is in balance, we have no issue. If the store raises the price on those lemons, people may stop buying them because they can be purchased more cheaply elsewhere. But what happens if/when the store has ONLY 1,000 lemons and suddenly everyone wants lemons. The store may sell 1,000 lemons in a single day and people line up the next morning hoping the story gets a shipment. They do, but because of supply issues, the store can only get 100. Demand will quickly outstrip supply and the store decides they can now charge double for the lemons because they know they will sell out. Rinse and repeat.\n\nNow, in real life, apply this to the toilet paper crisis following Covid.\n\nThe same concept plays out with stocks, but the ""float"" represents the total number of shares available for trade, period. Unless the company decides to issue more shares (dilution) to raise money, the float is the maximum number of shares available for public consumption/trade. This is why they say if you are buying shares in a stock expecting it to rise, you are purchasing the shares from someone expecting it to not go up, or the seller needs to raise cash. It\'s a barter system.\n\nNow apply this supply/demand construct to a stock with very few shares in the float. If 100,000 /WSB day traders all decide to purchase 100 shares of stock at the same time, that is 10,000,000 shares. If the stock only has 10,000,000 or 20,000,000 shares in the float, demand will far outstrip supply and the price rises because sellers can raise the price knowing there\'s enough demand to fill the trade. Of course, as we all know, at some point this price-to-demand model fails, demand dries up due to price and then the opposite can play out. Demand dries up, those who purchased decide to take profits, increasing supply and the price falls because too many shares are available with too few buyers.\n\nFloat is a very important variable in how stocks move, the volatility. Any stock with a low float can be manipulated and this is one thing the SEC is watching for. Of course, it\'s very difficult to prove manipulation. The higher the float of a stock, the more demand it will take to move the stock. if the /WSB group was more focused, they could be targeting low float stocks on a regular basis, moving in and out of them as a herd. It\'s hard to determine where the manipulation begins and ends. In the end, however, there are always those who caught on late, and end up with losses. The WSB bag holders, those behind the Wendy\'s dumpster or someone other than your wife\'s boyfriend. Insert your own WSB colloquialism here.\n\nThis is how stocks move up, down, go to the moon, crash and burn, etc. etc. taking traders along for the euphoric or painful ride. Obviously, in most situations, stocks trade via normal supply and demand as a result to their business model success, events, earnings, etc. Where /WSB started losing its teeth is when they started deemphasizing Sh!t stocks with low floats and decided to start tracking larger float quality names. The supply/demand model still plays out, but with less volatility due to the size of float in most of these stocks. High float, more demand needed to move the stock, less volatility.\n\n**My Single Best Trade**\n\nI have a long, maybe even storied, history in the markets. From full-on day trader back in the 90s and early 2000\'s to today. Back in mid 2020, I started accumulating a small marijuana stock by the name of Tilray ($TLRY), partly because we were in an election year and the republicans held office, there was continuing interest in marijuana legalization (I have never even tried the stuff), and I was starting to see more and more forum interest on the name, especially on /WSB.\n\nTLRY had a lower float, was gaining in popularity and there were other catalysts that I felt made it a worthwhile swing trade, maybe even a long term hold if legalization efforts broadened, the model worked and TLRY became very profitable.\n\nMaking a long story short, I started a two-phase position by a risk-weighted multiple-thousand share position between $4-$5/share in mid 2020. The stock was percolating but not moving materially for any length of time. After one particular volume spike, followed by a quick rise in price, the stock swelled to $7 but fell quickly back to $5. But what I noticed was the volume, /WSB mention and that price spike. When the stock settled again, volume was back to normal. Deciding to trade around my long shares, I started accumulating $5 leap (long dated) calls. What followed were events that I could not have accurately predicted. The democrats ended up in office, helping all pot stocks. TLRY\'s model was gaining favor as one of the largest producers. But what really took the top off was that /WSB erupted in all things TLRY for about a two week period beginning in Feb. 2021. The rise leading up to the spike was good, taking the stock to $20 and I peeled off some shares and even some of the calls to protect profits, leaving most of the position in place. The the day or two that followed, the stock erupted from $20, to an intraday price of more than $70. Fear and Greed in my own head kicked in and I waited and watched, eventually deciding to pull the trigger on the entire position around $60 as the stock started falling. I exited the entire position between $55-$60.\n\nChart for this time period is below.\n\n[TLRY - 6 mos. Chart](https://preview.redd.it/m38wqe3wgqvd1.png?width=1601&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2fd3997fa22676b05c83ca973be9bb4435236c4)\n\nThe % gain on the position was massive, both in liquidation of the long shares and, especially the Calls. In this case, my prudence still limited the gain to a % of what it could have been because I am never willing to allow a speculative position to occupy too heavy a weight due to risk management. It\'s fun to dream what this trade could have yielded if I was a true WSB degenerate but it was still quite sizable and material to the overall account. For relation, even as a right-sized speculation weight, the gain from this single trade boosted the account value by more than 25%, in a tax-advantaged account.\n\nTLRY is now back to $1.50 per share. It\'s model continues to erode. The fervor is gone but the potential remains simply due to history. TLRY is also a perfect example of one of my Phoenix trades (you can search for that on this sub). At one point in the past, TLRY spiked to $300. That is an important aspect to a phoenix trade.\n\nThis is how speculation can work but, in most cases, it does not. Traders chase profits like these but a vast majority of time it ends in fire and flames, bag holders and loss porn. Sometimes a big gain is the worst thing an individual can have. Those without discipline to understand fear, greed and gambling are lined up for a trip to complete ruin. I never tried to recreate this trade though I still dabble in right-sized speculation ($SOUN) on the potential. Keep positions very low in % and very few in number.\n\nLightning can strike but do yourself a favor and never expect and, if it does strike, don\'t expect it to strike again in the same place.\n\nLearn to look at ""float"" for an opportunity for long term gains. Low float stocks with good business models can split, increasing your shares and leading to incredible profits. You only need one $AAPL, $MSFT, $NVDA, $NFLX, $CSCO, $META, $GOOGL to go to the moon and take your net worth with it.

Reddit,AAPL,"{'title': 'Wealth Realization - we are fools trying not to be foolish', 'content': ""Hello r/FatFIRE community! We (63m, 60f) wanted to share a bit about our current financial situation and plans as we continue to navigate the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) journey. Both started with nothing, worked our way through school and had wonderful careers. We have retired a few times over the past twenty years but, after a year or two, went back to work. We finally retired eight years ago.\n\nFinancial Overview:\nNet Worth: $24.7M\n\nAssets:\n\t•\tStock Portfolio: $15.6M, primarily in AAPL (acquired in the early 90s, near-zero cost basis)\n\t•\tEquity in LLC (apartments): $6.1M\n\t•\tReal Estate: $4.5M in assets across two apartment complexes and three homes\n\t•\tOther: $745K\n\nLiabilities:\n\t•\tMortgage on 2nd Home (MCOL): $630K at 3.1% (28-year term)\n\t•\tRental Property Loan: $1.58M at 2.7% (balloon payment due December 2026)\n\t•\tCredit Card Balance (paid monthly): $9K\n\nIncome and Expenses:\nIncome:\n\t•\tDividends and Rentals: $260K/year\nAnnual Expenses:\n\t•\tCity Condo Currently Renting (VHCOL): $50K\n\t•\t1st Home (VHCOL): $12K\n\t•\t2nd Home (MCOL): $48K\n\t•\tTravel: Approximately $24K annually (four months of travel at ~$200/day)\nWe’ve been fortunate to reach this position through a mix of stock investments, real estate, and steady income streams. Our focus now is on optimizing asset allocation, managing taxes, and setting up systems for efficient wealth transfer to our children.\n\nAdvisor Suggestions:\nWe recently had a meeting with our financial advisors, and we’d love to get the community's opinions on some options they presented:\n\nStructured Ownership Program (SOP):\n\t•\tThis strategy involves a Series LLC that generates profits through activities like factoring and foreign exchange trading. The key benefit is receiving a large K1 loss (up to 8x ordinary income or 10x capital gains) relative to your capital contribution. This could potentially defer taxes for long periods, with the loan renewable every 15 years without triggering taxable gains, as long as you don't exit early.\n\t•\tExample: A $300K capital contribution generates a $2.7M loan (9x), creating a $3M tax basis to offset $3M in capital gains.\n\t•\tCost: 3.5% of the K1 value upfront, plus an additional 4% fee to cover taxes on the gains in the first year. For a $3M capital gain, this would total $225K.\n\t•\tNet Cash Benefit: $450K saved compared to paying $855K in taxes without the strategy.\n\t•\tNote: This strategy defers both federal and state taxes.\n\tQuestion: Has anyone here used a similar program? How did it work out in terms of long-term benefits and risks?\n\nTax Credits (Sovereign Tribal Federal Tax Credits):\nInvest in infrastructure improvements to Native Americans, to help them build water treatments, schools, roads, etc. this gives them money for big projects and in return you get tax credits to help lower federal taxes. They were granted tax credits for exactly this purpose. \n\t•\tThese credits are available for 60 cents on the dollar, with a minimum investment of $60,000.\n\t•\tThey offset federal tax liability dollar-for-dollar, with the ability to carry forward unused credits for up to five years.\n\t•\tNote: This does not affect state taxes.\n\t\nQuestion: Have you used tax credits to offset liabilities? Do you think these credits provide significant value relative to their cost?\n\t\nLeverage Charitable Donation:\n\t•\tThis option eliminates taxes through charitable donations, with fewer future concerns than the SOP but potentially slightly lower savings.\n\tQuestion: What are your thoughts on structured donations for tax savings vs. something like SOP?\n\t\nAsset Protection and Estate Planning:\n\t•\tWe are in the process of setting up trusts to protect assets and manage estate taxes.\n\tQuestion: What strategies have you used to stay below estate tax limits and protect assets effectively?\n\t\nInvestment Strategy:\n\t•\tWe’re discussing selling and diversifying up to half of our AAPL stock to balance growth potential with risk management.\n\tQuestion: How do you manage the diversification of large, single-stock positions while maintaining strong growth prospects?\n\nAdditional Thoughts:\n\t•\tLong-term Wealth Management Considerations:\n\t•\tShift from growth to preservation mindset\n\t•\tDiversification away from concentrated position\n\t•\tEstate planning: trusts, staying below estate tax limits\n\t•\tPotential future gifts to children (e.g., paying off mortgages)\n\t•\tPersonal Reflections:\n\t•\tStruggle to shift from frugal mindset to higher spending\n\t•\tDesire for experiences (e.g., family trips) vs. continued wealth accumulation\n\t•\tBalancing prudent financial management with enjoying wealth\n\t•\tOur AGI for the past five years has been around $55K.\n\t•\tWe also gift the maximum stock to our four successful adult children annually.\n\t•\tWe’re considering a 2025 stock liquidation amount between $500K and $3M, might even sell up to $8M.\n\nThanks for taking a moment to read.

This doesn't count our ~6 month emergency fund sitting in HYSAs and checking accounts.\n\nOur typical monthly spend is about 5.5k, but for planning purposes I round that up to 6k. We live in a growing MCOL area and own a home with about 75k in equity. If we plan to retire when I'm 65 and assume a 6% average real return over the next 36 years, it seems we'll hit coastFI after one more month of investment contributions. We're investing about 4-5k per month right now. Our investments are primarily broad US equity index funds, individual stocks (e.g., NVDA, MSFT), and a bit of international equity and bonds thrown in.\n\nMy wife has a fairly low stress job and works 4 days per week. My job is higher stress and I work the standard 5 days with some evening and weekend work on top of that. Fortunately, both of us are fully remote.\n\nWhile my wife doesn't mind her job, it's not her passion and she would likely be more fulfilled in different (lower paying) work.\n\nThere are aspects of my job I like, but it is stressful and I see it as a means to an end. I am interested in the idea of asking to move from FT to PT in my current role, maybe becoming an independent consultant, or taking a different job with lower stress and pay.\n\nDoes this seem reasonable or are we being too optimistic in our projections? Part of me wants to grind at our current rate for a few more years to beef up the nest egg. But, even if both of us take lower pay, we could likely continue to invest but maybe in the neighborhood of 1-2k per month instead.\n\nAny thoughts are appreciated.\n\n"", 'author': 'awbckr25', 'created_utc': 1729393584.0, 'score': 6, 'num_comments': 13, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/coastFIRE/comments/1g7pie9/are_we_coastfi/'}"

Reddit,MSFT,"{'title': 'Trading Tactics: Wall Street Bets (WSB), Herd Mentality, Float & My Single Greatest Trade', 'content': 'You can\'t be in the markets and not know the now infamous Wall Street Bets subreddit in all its glory. In fact, it even has its own movie: Dumb Money. Being honest, it was a fun watch while on a flight.\n\nThe interesting thing about WSB is that it\'s not a new concept, but one that gained popularity because of the popularity of the Internet, Reddit and herd mentality in equal parts to create something that wasn\'t possible ""back in the day."" In 1998 I was part of a similar group, but without the wide appeal because we didn\'t have Reddit back then. We had a site by the name Silicon Investor, where I would eventually start my own stock thread. Similar to Roaring Kitty, ""Tokyo Joe"" started a thread called ""Society Anonyme"" and it quickly became a popular site for high volatility stock trading, discussion and basically the same thing that WSB is today. In fact, while the last post to that thread occurred in 2008, you can still see the subject and its history here:\n\n[https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=21973](https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=21973)\n\nTokyo Joe would eventually face charges surrounding stock manipulation, etc. It truly is a very similar story to that of WSB. I was a frequent poster on his board and many private conversations with him back in the day before I started seeing the true nature of what was going on.\n\nThe key point here is that herd mentality has always been a part of stock trading and markets. Whether in the short term, or the long term, it\'s a pure supply-demand scenario. The primary difference between then and now is the size of the herd, and it\'s a sizable difference. Add in the ability for electronic, algo-driven, high frequency trading on exchanges and you have the ability to move a lot of shares very quickly, potentially \'manipulating\' a stock. Again, it\'s supply and demand in its purest form.\n\nAll stocks have something you should pay attention to:  Float. This is the number of shares available for public trading. Some stocks may have a float of only a few million (or less) while others like $NVDA, could have in the double digit billions. This is where supply and demand economics plays out.\n\nIf you go to the store to purchase lemons and the store has 1,000 lemons in the bin, buying a few lemons will not impact the price. The store may only sell 300 lemons per day and get 300 lemons in shipment the next day to replace the supply. As long as demand is in balance, we have no issue. If the store raises the price on those lemons, people may stop buying them because they can be purchased more cheaply elsewhere. But what happens if/when the store has ONLY 1,000 lemons and suddenly everyone wants lemons. The store may sell 1,000 lemons in a single day and people line up the next morning hoping the story gets a shipment. They do, but because of supply issues, the store can only get 100. Demand will quickly outstrip supply and the store decides they can now charge double for the lemons because they know they will sell out. Rinse and repeat.\n\nNow, in real life, apply this to the toilet paper crisis following Covid.\n\nThe same concept plays out with stocks, but the ""float"" represents the total number of shares available for trade, period. Unless the company decides to issue more shares (dilution) to raise money, the float is the maximum number of shares available for public consumption/trade. This is why they say if you are buying shares in a stock expecting it to rise, you are purchasing the shares from someone expecting it to not go up, or the seller needs to raise cash. It\'s a barter system.\n\nNow apply this supply/demand construct to a stock with very few shares in the float. If 100,000 /WSB day traders all decide to purchase 100 shares of stock at the same time, that is 10,000,000 shares. If the stock only has 10,000,000 or 20,000,000 shares in the float, demand will far outstrip supply and the price rises because sellers can raise the price knowing there\'s enough demand to fill the trade. Of course, as we all know, at some point this price-to-demand model fails, demand dries up due to price and then the opposite can play out. Demand dries up, those who purchased decide to take profits, increasing supply and the price falls because too many shares are available with too few buyers.\n\nFloat is a very important variable in how stocks move, the volatility. Any stock with a low float can be manipulated and this is one thing the SEC is watching for. Of course, it\'s very difficult to prove manipulation. The higher the float of a stock, the more demand it will take to move the stock. if the /WSB group was more focused, they could be targeting low float stocks on a regular basis, moving in and out of them as a herd. It\'s hard to determine where the manipulation begins and ends. In the end, however, there are always those who caught on late, and end up with losses. The WSB bag holders, those behind the Wendy\'s dumpster or someone other than your wife\'s boyfriend. Insert your own WSB colloquialism here.\n\nThis is how stocks move up, down, go to the moon, crash and burn, etc. etc. taking traders along for the euphoric or painful ride. Obviously, in most situations, stocks trade via normal supply and demand as a result to their business model success, events, earnings, etc. Where /WSB started losing its teeth is when they started deemphasizing Sh!t stocks with low floats and decided to start tracking larger float quality names. The supply/demand model still plays out, but with less volatility due to the size of float in most of these stocks. High float, more demand needed to move the stock, less volatility.\n\n**My Single Best Trade**\n\nI have a long, maybe even storied, history in the markets. From full-on day trader back in the 90s and early 2000\'s to today. Back in mid 2020, I started accumulating a small marijuana stock by the name of Tilray ($TLRY), partly because we were in an election year and the republicans held office, there was continuing interest in marijuana legalization (I have never even tried the stuff), and I was starting to see more and more forum interest on the name, especially on /WSB.\n\nTLRY had a lower float, was gaining in popularity and there were other catalysts that I felt made it a worthwhile swing trade, maybe even a long term hold if legalization efforts broadened, the model worked and TLRY became very profitable.\n\nMaking a long story short, I started a two-phase position by a risk-weighted multiple-thousand share position between $4-$5/share in mid 2020. The stock was percolating but not moving materially for any length of time. After one particular volume spike, followed by a quick rise in price, the stock swelled to $7 but fell quickly back to $5. But what I noticed was the volume, /WSB mention and that price spike. When the stock settled again, volume was back to normal. Deciding to trade around my long shares, I started accumulating $5 leap (long dated) calls. What followed were events that I could not have accurately predicted. The democrats ended up in office, helping all pot stocks. TLRY\'s model was gaining favor as one of the largest producers. But what really took the top off was that /WSB erupted in all things TLRY for about a two week period beginning in Feb. 2021. The rise leading up to the spike was good, taking the stock to $20 and I peeled off some shares and even some of the calls to protect profits, leaving most of the position in place. The the day or two that followed, the stock erupted from $20, to an intraday price of more than $70. Fear and Greed in my own head kicked in and I waited and watched, eventually deciding to pull the trigger on the entire position around $60 as the stock started falling. I exited the entire position between $55-$60.\n\nChart for this time period is below.\n\n[TLRY - 6 mos. Chart](https://preview.redd.it/m38wqe3wgqvd1.png?width=1601&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2fd3997fa22676b05c83ca973be9bb4435236c4)\n\nThe % gain on the position was massive, both in liquidation of the long shares and, especially the Calls. In this case, my prudence still limited the gain to a % of what it could have been because I am never willing to allow a speculative position to occupy too heavy a weight due to risk management. It\'s fun to dream what this trade could have yielded if I was a true WSB degenerate but it was still quite sizable and material to the overall account. For relation, even as a right-sized speculation weight, the gain from this single trade boosted the account value by more than 25%, in a tax-advantaged account.\n\nTLRY is now back to $1.50 per share. It\'s model continues to erode. The fervor is gone but the potential remains simply due to history. TLRY is also a perfect example of one of my Phoenix trades (you can search for that on this sub). At one point in the past, TLRY spiked to $300. That is an important aspect to a phoenix trade.\n\nThis is how speculation can work but, in most cases, it does not. Traders chase profits like these but a vast majority of time it ends in fire and flames, bag holders and loss porn. Sometimes a big gain is the worst thing an individual can have. Those without discipline to understand fear, greed and gambling are lined up for a trip to complete ruin. I never tried to recreate this trade though I still dabble in right-sized speculation ($SOUN) on the potential. Keep positions very low in % and very few in number.\n\nLightning can strike but do yourself a favor and never expect and, if it does strike, don\'t expect it to strike again in the same place.\n\nLearn to look at ""float"" for an opportunity for long term gains. Low float stocks with good business models can split, increasing your shares and leading to incredible profits. You only need one $AAPL, $MSFT, $NVDA, $NFLX, $CSCO, $META, $GOOGL to go to the moon and take your net worth with it.

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': ' Cash Management Account - what affects my ability to withdraw?', 'content': ""I was recently looking over the previous threads here on Fidelity's changing Cash Management accounts to allow SPAXX as a core position instead of the FDIC-insured deposit sweep.\n\nThere were a few responses from people who just manually buy a different money market fund (like FDLXX) instead of relying on their core position. That's what I'd prefer, since I'd like the additional safety and state tax advantages of investing only in Treasuries.\n\nBut wouldn't this affect your ability to withdraw funds from the account via check or debit card? Fidelity advertises that the CMA is technically a brokerage account - you could buy whatever securities you wanted in it if you didn't want to hold the whole balance as cash. But then you'd presumably not be able to just go to the ATM and get cash out from that amount - you could only do it from your core account position. \n\nIs this how it works?\n\n**Case A:** you leave the whole balance in the core position, either SPAXX or the FDIC-insured sweep. This one seems straightforward - [you should be able to withdraw](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/faqs-about-account#:~:text=How%20Your%20Core%20Position%20Works,account%20to%20make%20a%20purchase) whatever you want against that balance.\n\n**Case B**: you put some or all of your CMA balance into some relatively-illiquid security. Let's say you buy AMZN stock or the Fidelity Total Bond ETF or whatever with it. I assume that this case is straightforward, too: since the money is tied up in these securities, you need to manually sell them first for the cash to be withdrawable. (Fidelity's not going to liquidate $120 worth of AMZN automatically from your CMA every time you go to the ATM.)\n\n**Case C**: you put some or all of your CMA balance into a non-core-position money market fund like FDLXX. Despite the high liquidity of money market funds, this is still functionally equivalent to Case B, right? Since the money isn't in your core position, and all cash transactions are handled entirely through your core position, checks and whatnot won't be deducted from this amount automatically. Instead, you have to manually go in and sell FDLXX for cash before you can withdraw the cash. \n\nDo I have that right? (If this is correct, consider this post a vote in favor of adding other money market options for the CMA core position.)"", 'author': 'bw98765', 'created_utc': 1729398698.0, 'score': 1, 'num_comments': 1, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/1g7qvqx/cash_management_account_what_affects_my_ability/'}"
Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'The Nature of the Soul by Lucille Cedercrans', 'content': '🌿 **Detailed Overview:**\n\nA profound exploration of the evolutionary shift humanity is undergoing, from self-consciousness to Soul consciousness. Cedercrans emphasizes that every human being is on the precipice of awakening to their Soul, a natural progression driven by the force of evolution. This book provides a series of teachings designed to help individuals recognize and connect with the Soul, encouraging the cultivation of higher awareness and spiritual understanding. Through the practice of meditation and introspection, readers are invited to explore the relationship between the Soul and its lower, material counterpart. Cedercrans offers a new ""Thought-Form Presentation of the Wisdom"" as a tool for spiritual seekers, allowing them to abstract divine knowledge through meditation and translate it into practical understanding for everyday life.\n\n🔍 **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n• **The Evolutionary Shift to Soul Consciousness:** Cedercrans emphasizes that humanity is at a turning point, moving beyond mere self-consciousness toward the greater realization of Soul consciousness. This evolution is a natural and inevitable process, driven by the Soul’s desire to express itself through the physical world. Humanity’s dissatisfaction with materialism is a sign of this inner awakening, a call to seek higher spiritual values.\n\n• **The Soul’s Presence in Mass Consciousness:** The book highlights that the Soul is actively influencing mass consciousness, pushing humanity toward spiritual awakening. Cedercrans notes that this influence is universal, affecting men and women everywhere, often manifesting as restlessness or discontent with material life. The collective search for peace and meaning is an expression of the Soul’s movement within humanity.\n\n• **Meditation as a Path to Soul Recognition:** Central to Cedercrans\' teachings is the practice of meditation, which she describes as the key method for contacting the Soul. Through meditation, individuals can access abstract spiritual wisdom and translate it into practical, concrete understanding. This practice fosters a deeper connection with the Soul and accelerates the process of awakening.\n\n• **The New Thought-Form Presentation of The Wisdom:** Cedercrans introduces a ""New Thought-Form Presentation of The Wisdom,"" a spiritual tool designed to help seekers access higher knowledge through meditation. This presentation represents a modern interpretation of ageless wisdom, providing practical guidance for individuals who are ready to engage with their Soul and the greater spiritual truths of the universe.\n\n• **The Role of the Soul in Personal and Collective Awakening:** The book outlines the Soul’s role in guiding both individual and collective spiritual evolution. As more individuals awaken to their Soul, they contribute to the overall spiritual transformation of humanity. Cedercrans argues that this awakening is the key to bringing lasting peace and harmony to the world, as it aligns humanity with the divine will.\n\n🕊️ **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders will gain a deep understanding of the evolutionary journey toward Soul consciousness and how it is shaping the world today. Through meditation and the application of spiritual wisdom, individuals can cultivate a deeper connection with their Soul and contribute to the collective awakening of humanity. The teachings in *The Nature of the Soul* provide practical tools for spiritual growth and personal transformation, guiding readers toward a more peaceful and purposeful life.\n\n💌 **Your Experiences and Reflections:**\n\nHave you ever felt a deep inner restlessness or dissatisfaction with material life that led you to seek something higher? How has meditation or spiritual practice helped you connect with your Soul or experience deeper peace? Share your reflections on how the teachings in this book resonate with your own spiritual journey and the collective awakening of humanity.\n\n* [Kindle](https://amzn.to/4eMmjDu)\n* [Amazon Paperback](https://amzn.to/3BQCNfn)', 'author': 'xMysticChimez', 'created_utc': 1729396964.0, 'score': 1, 'num_comments': 0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/MeditationHub/comments/1g7qfj1/the_nature_of_the_soul_by_lucille_cedercrans/'}"

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'The Physics of God: How the Deepest Theories of Science Explain Religion and How the Deepest Truths of Religion Explain Science by Joseph Selbie', 'content': '🌿 **Detailed Overview:**\n\nA groundbreaking exploration of the parallels between cutting-edge scientific discoveries and ancient spiritual truths. The book bridges the gap between science and religion, offering an accessible explanation of complex topics such as quantum physics, relativity, neuroscience, and string theory, while drawing connections to spiritual experiences like miracles, immortality, and transcendent awareness. Selbie’s central thesis is that the concepts traditionally labeled as ""spiritual"" or ""mystical"" are not only compatible with, but are deeply supported by modern scientific theories. Through clear metaphors and practical examples, Selbie seeks to dissolve the apparent conflict between science and religion, inviting readers to embrace a unified understanding of reality.\n\n🔍 **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n• **Unity of Science and Spirituality:** Selbie argues that the perceived divide between science and spirituality is an illusion. By examining quantum physics, M-theory, and neuroscience, he reveals that many phenomena described by saints, mystics, and near-death experiences can be explained through the lens of modern science. This unity offers a profound shift in perspective, suggesting that science and religion are two sides of the same coin, both seeking to understand the same ultimate reality.\n\n• **Quantum Biology and Immortality:** One of the book’s more intriguing concepts is how quantum biology provides a scientific explanation for immortality. Selbie explains that human consciousness and the body are entangled in ways that defy traditional biological understanding, suggesting that consciousness persists beyond physical death. This scientific framework mirrors religious teachings on the soul and the afterlife, providing a bridge between faith-based beliefs and empirical research.\n\n• **Transcendent Awareness and the Power of Mind:** Drawing on discoveries in neuroscience and relativity, Selbie emphasizes the mind’s ability to create miracles and bring about instantaneous changes in the physical body. He connects this power to the teachings of spiritual leaders who have long claimed that thoughts and beliefs shape reality. This insight suggests that the human mind has far more control over the physical world than previously understood.\n\n• **Meditation as a Gateway to Transcendence:** The newly added chapter on the physics of meditation delves into how the practice aligns with the brain’s natural frequencies and quantum states. Meditation, according to Selbie, enhances one\'s ability to access transcendent awareness by harmonizing with the energy fields described in quantum physics. This connection provides a scientific basis for the spiritual benefits long attributed to meditative practices.\n\n• **M-Theory and Multidimensional Reality:** The book also connects string theory’s brane worlds—the hidden dimensions of M-theory—to the religious concept of transcendent heavens. Selbie argues that these dimensions are not only scientifically plausible but have been described by spiritual traditions for millennia. This suggests that the ""heavens"" described in religion may be multidimensional realms that science is only beginning to understand.\n\n🕊️ **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders will walk away with a renewed perspective on the compatibility of science and spirituality. Selbie\'s explanations offer hope for those who feel torn between the rationality of science and the transcendence of religion, providing tools for personal transformation through meditation and conscious living. This book is ideal for anyone seeking to reconcile their spiritual beliefs with scientific understanding and for those curious about how the deepest truths of the universe intersect with our daily lives.\n\n💌 **Your Experiences and Reflections:**\n\nHave you ever encountered a spiritual experience that felt deeply connected to scientific principles?

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'As Above, So Below: Paths to Spiritual Renewal in Daily Life by Ronald S. Miller', 'content': '🌿 **Detailed Overview:**\n\nA profound exploration of spirituality and how it can be integrated into everyday experiences. Drawing on various spiritual traditions, psychological insights, and mythological frameworks, Miller encourages readers to find the extraordinary within the ordinary aspects of their daily lives. The book delves into the wisdom of the Western spiritual tradition, shamanic practices, transpersonal psychology, and feminine spirituality, among others, to create a comprehensive guide for personal and spiritual growth. With an emphasis on holistic understanding, Miller offers a path to renewal that is both practical and deeply transformative.\n\n🔍 **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n• **Spirituality in the Mundane:** Miller emphasizes that spirituality is not something separate from daily life but is found in the ordinary moments that make up our existence. This theme invites readers to look for moments of connection, meaning, and transcendence in the simplest activities—whether it’s in conversations, nature, or even routine tasks—showing that the divine is always present.\n\n• **Western Spiritual Tradition and Transpersonal Psychology:** The book explores the integration of Western spiritual traditions with modern psychological insights, particularly transpersonal psychology, which bridges psychology and spirituality. Miller highlights how Western spirituality, traditionally rooted in religious practices, can evolve to meet the needs of the contemporary seeker, using psychology as a tool for deep self-exploration and spiritual transformation.\n\n• **Shamanism and Mythology as Tools for Renewal:** Drawing on the ancient practices of shamanism and mythological narratives, Miller provides a framework for readers to reconnect with primal sources of wisdom. He shows how shamanic practices can facilitate healing and spiritual renewal by tapping into the unseen realms, and how mythology provides symbolic maps for navigating life’s challenges and transitions.\n\n• **Feminine Spirituality and Holistic Balance:** Miller acknowledges the resurgence of feminine spirituality and its role in balancing the often patriarchal tendencies in traditional religious frameworks. He explores how integrating the feminine—through values like intuition, compassion, and nurturing—can offer a more holistic approach to spiritual growth, contributing to a renewal of both personal and collective consciousness.\n\n• **Paths to Personal Transformation:** The overarching message of the book is that personal transformation is available to everyone, not just through isolated spiritual practices but by engaging fully in life. Miller offers practical advice on how to cultivate mindfulness, develop self-awareness, and create meaningful spiritual practices that align with the flow of daily life, helping readers renew themselves spiritually and emotionally.\n\n🕊️ **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders will discover how spirituality can be woven into the fabric of their daily lives, offering a path to renewal and deeper meaning. Through exploring diverse traditions such as shamanism, mythology, and psychology, they will find accessible tools to transform their everyday experiences into moments of spiritual insight. The book serves as a reminder that personal growth and spiritual transformation do not require grand gestures but are found in living with intention and awareness.\n\n💌 **Your Experiences and Reflections:**\n\nHow do you incorporate spirituality into your daily routine?

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'The End of Your World: Uncensored Straight Talk on the Nature of Enlightenment by Adyashanti ', 'content': '🌿 **Detailed Overview:**\n\nAddresses the often-overlooked phase of spiritual awakening—the period after an individual first ""wakes up"" to a new reality. This book provides a candid, no-frills guide to navigating the complexities and challenges that arise after the initial experience of enlightenment, shedding light on the nuances of what comes next. Adyashanti speaks directly to those who have had spiritual breakthroughs and are seeking direction, emphasizing the common fluctuations between temporary awakening and the more permanent state of abiding enlightenment. This work serves as a practical and spiritual roadmap for living fully in the awakened state.\n\n🔍 **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n• **The Transition from Awakening to Abiding Enlightenment:** Adyashanti introduces the distinction between ""nonabiding"" and ""abiding"" enlightenment, explaining that many people experience awakening in fleeting moments, only to feel that it slips away. He calls this the ""I got it/I lost it"" cycle, which can lead to confusion and frustration. This theme underscores the deeper work required to transition from temporary spiritual experiences to a stable, lived experience of enlightenment.\n\n• **Pitfalls and Traps of the Ego Post-Awakening:** After awakening, the ego can subtly reassert itself, creating a range of obstacles on the path to full realization. Adyashanti warns about common traps such as the illusion of spiritual superiority, where individuals might feel ""better"" or more enlightened than others, and the tendency for the ego to use spiritual insights for its own gain. This theme emphasizes the importance of staying vigilant and continuously questioning one’s motives and perceptions.\n\n• **The Danger of Becoming “Drunk on Emptiness”:** One of the more profound insights Adyashanti discusses is the tendency for individuals to become overly attached to the experience of emptiness or nothingness that can accompany spiritual awakening. He calls this being ""drunk on emptiness"" and warns that it can lead to detachment from life and emotional isolation. This theme is crucial as it highlights the necessity of integrating spiritual insight with real-world engagement, rather than withdrawing into a state of separation.\n\n• **The Trap of Meaninglessness and Embracing Life Fully:** Many who awaken may experience a sense of meaninglessness, as their old frameworks of understanding are dissolved. Adyashanti guides readers through this existential dilemma, helping them see beyond the illusion of meaninglessness and embrace life with renewed vigor. This theme encourages readers to find joy and meaning in the present moment, beyond conceptual beliefs.\n\n• **Radical Honesty and Continuous Self-Inquiry:** A central tenet of Adyashanti’s teachings is the need for sincere self-inquiry and radical honesty. Full awakening, he asserts, comes from questioning everything—every belief, every identity, and even the nature of the self itself. This theme highlights that enlightenment is not a one-time event but an ongoing process of deepening understanding and dismantling of the egoic structures that obscure reality.\n\n🕊️ **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders will gain invaluable insights into the often-unspoken challenges that arise after spiritual awakening. Adyashanti’s guidance offers both comfort and challenge, urging those on the path to confront the subtle ways in which the ego can re-emerge and co-opt enlightenment. By embracing radical honesty, continuous self-inquiry, and a deep engagement with life, readers will be better equipped to transition from fleeting moments of awakening to the full, abiding state of enlightenment.\n\n💌 **Your Experiences and Reflections:**\n\nHave you experienced moments of spiritual awakening that seemed to slip away?

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'The Way of Liberation: A Practical Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment by Adyashanti', 'content': '🌿 **Detailed Overview:**\n\nA direct and practical approach to spiritual awakening, emphasizing simplicity in the process of realizing the true nature of Reality. The book is not centered around spiritual enhancement or achieving self-improvement, but rather about moving beyond the illusion of the ego to an awakened state of being. Adyashanti provides readers with foundational ideas, orienting concepts, and core practices designed to strip away the constructs of the egoic mind and bring about liberation. His teachings reflect the urgency and efficiency required for spiritual awakening, offering a guide that is both deeply transformative and accessible for spiritual seekers.\n\n🔍 **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n• **Foundations of Spiritual Awakening:** Adyashanti outlines the core tenets that form the bedrock of spiritual awakening, urging readers to question their beliefs, release attachments, and realize the truth beyond egoic identity. He emphasizes that the journey to enlightenment begins by recognizing the limitations of the self and the illusions created by the ego. This foundational theme is meant to help seekers strip away the false layers of identity, leading them toward a state of pure consciousness.\n\n• **Orienting Ideas for Spiritual Practice:** The book introduces key ideas that help guide seekers on their spiritual path, focusing on concepts such as truth, liberation, and surrender. Adyashanti encourages readers to let go of preconceived notions and mental constructs that bind them to suffering and separation. By aligning their orientation with these deeper truths, individuals are able to shift their focus from ego-driven desires to the pursuit of genuine freedom.\n\n• **Core Practices for Liberation:** Adyashanti provides practical exercises and meditative practices that are aimed at facilitating direct experience of Reality. These practices focus on letting go of control, embracing stillness, and deeply observing the nature of consciousness. The core practices serve as powerful tools for individuals to confront their own mental and emotional obstacles, ultimately leading to the dissolution of the ego and the realization of their true, boundless nature.\n\n• **Beyond Ego to Awakened Being:** Central to Adyashanti’s teachings is the process of moving from the dream-like state of egoic consciousness to the awakened state, where one experiences the flow of existence free from the constraints of self-identity. He emphasizes that awakening is not about achieving an enhanced state of being, but rather the realization of what already is—the infinite and sacred nature of Reality. This theme highlights the immediacy of awakening and the necessity of leaving behind all attachments to the self.\n\n• **Living Enlightenment in Daily Life:** The final aspect of Adyashanti’s teachings addresses the importance of embodying spiritual awakening in daily life. He underscores that liberation is not just a mystical experience but must be fully lived in every aspect of existence. By integrating awakened awareness into everyday actions and interactions, individuals can experience a profound sense of peace, authenticity, and freedom in their relationships, work, and personal life.\n\n🕊️ **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders will be equipped with the essential ideas and practices needed to embark on the journey to spiritual enlightenment. This book serves as a guide for seekers who are ready to confront their egoic limitations and experience the deeper reality that lies beyond the self.

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'Neuroscience Wealth Strategy: A Review of Trading Beyond the Matrix by Van K. Tharp', 'content': 'In the world of trading and investing, it is often believed that success hinges on mastering the markets, following the right strategies, and making smart financial decisions. However, Van K. Tharp’s *Trading Beyond the Matrix: The Red Pill for Traders and Investors* offers a radical shift in perspective, suggesting that the most important factor in achieving financial success is self-transformation. This book transcends the typical analysis of market dynamics and instead delves deep into personal psychology, neuroscience, and the power of beliefs in shaping our financial outcomes.\n\n# The Core Premise: Transformation Through “Tharp Think”\n\nAt its core, *Trading Beyond the Matrix* is about changing one’s mindset to unlock wealth-building potential. Tharp presents what he calls ""Tharp Think,"" a series of principles derived from studying top traders\' behavior and beliefs. These principles go beyond traditional trading strategies, highlighting that it is not just about what traders know, but how they think and act. According to Tharp, the majority of traders fail because they are trapped by limiting beliefs—what he calls “the Matrix”—that cloud their decision-making and prevent them from seeing the market as it truly is.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the film *The Matrix*, Tharp explains that people are often programmed with destructive beliefs imposed by society, which leads to self-sabotage. These beliefs, deeply rooted in fear, greed, and unconscious biases, create a mental “Matrix” that distorts reality and hinders financial progress. By taking the metaphorical “red pill” and stepping out of this mental trap, individuals can achieve the clarity necessary for success. This, in essence, is the foundation of his neuroscience-based wealth strategy.\n\n[How to transform your trading results by transforming yourself](https://preview.redd.it/vt04rbz8ervd1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=64cd11c1b4293b02349b1f72f4ccc4dc3f10e857)\n\nCheck: [Trading Beyond the Matrix: The Red Pill for Traders and Investors](https://amzn.to/3Yy9qGv)\n\n# Neuroscience and the Psychology of Wealth\n\nTharp\'s approach aligns with modern understandings of neuroscience, particularly in how the brain processes fear and reward. The human brain is wired to avoid risk and seek comfort, but in the high-stakes world of trading, these instincts can lead to poor decisions. Neuroscience teaches that much of our behavior is driven by subconscious processes that can be reprogrammed through focused self-awareness and deliberate practice.\n\n*Trading Beyond the Matrix* emphasizes that wealth creation is largely a mental game. Tharp provides tools for traders to ""reprogram"" their minds, moving away from reactive patterns driven by fear and greed. This approach is not only effective in trading but also in any endeavor where the stakes are high, and emotional control is critical. By aligning one’s beliefs with a mindset of abundance and acceptance, traders can tap into their higher cognitive functions—what Tharp describes as trading from a state of joy and acceptance, rather than from fear and desperation.\n\n# The Neuroscience of Belief Systems: Reprogramming for Success\n\nOne of the central elements of the book is the exploration of belief systems and how they govern behavior. Tharp argues that successful traders are distinguished not by their technical knowledge of the markets, but by their ability to adopt empowering beliefs and discard those that no longer serve them. He likens this process to a form of self-transformation that can be achieved through various techniques, including mindfulness, affirmations, and neuro-linguistic programming (NLP).\n\nNeuroscience supports the idea that beliefs are not fixed and can be changed with deliberate effort. By repeatedly engaging in behaviors and thought patterns that align with success, individuals can create new neural pathways that support more productive and empowering financial behaviors. This concept of neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections—is a key component of Tharp’s strategy. The idea is that traders can ""rewire"" their brains for success by adopting the mindset of top traders and practicing it until it becomes second nature.\n\n# Transforming Wealth Strategy Through Consciousness\n\nTharp\'s wealth strategy is rooted in the idea that consciousness and self-awareness are critical to financial success. In one of the book’s key sections, he explains that many traders operate on a low level of consciousness, driven by reactive emotions like fear and greed. These emotional states activate the brain’s survival mechanisms, which can lead to impulsive and irrational decisions—exactly the kind of behavior that causes losses in the stock market.\n\nThe goal, according to Tharp, is to elevate one’s consciousness to higher levels where acceptance and joy replace fear and greed. At these levels, traders are able to remain calm and make more rational decisions, even in the face of market volatility. This ties into the concept of emotional regulation in neuroscience, where maintaining a balanced emotional state allows for better cognitive performance, particularly in high-pressure environments.\n\n# Practical Application: Real Transformations\n\nThe most powerful aspect of *Trading Beyond the Matrix* lies in the real-life stories of transformation that Tharp shares throughout the book. Each chapter focuses on a different individual who applied Tharp’s methods and experienced significant personal and financial breakthroughs. These stories serve as case studies, illustrating how the combination of self-awareness, belief transformation, and emotional regulation can lead to remarkable success.\n\nIn one example, a trader who had been struggling for years managed to completely turn his performance around by adopting Tharp Think and working on his limiting beliefs. The transformation wasn’t just in his financial success, but in his overall well-being and mindset. This practical application of neuroscience principles shows that success in the market is not just about mastering strategies, but mastering oneself.\n\n*Trading Beyond the Matrix* offers more than just trading advice—it provides a blueprint for personal transformation that leads to financial success. By tapping into the latest insights from neuroscience and psychology, Tharp teaches traders to reprogram their minds, elevating their consciousness and eliminating the limiting beliefs that keep them trapped in the Matrix. His wealth strategy is about mastering the inner game, which, once conquered, can lead to extraordinary results in the outer world of trading and beyond.\n\nFor those looking to improve not only their financial outcomes but also their overall mindset, this book is a powerful resource. It teaches that wealth begins within, and by transforming one’s mind, it is possible to achieve lasting success.\n\nRelated: [When is the subconscious mind most active?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Askfreedom_Jinn/comments/1g7ccvz/when_is_the_subconscious_mind_most_active/)\n\n**Related Important Suggestions:** \n\n>`Like the left-hand image shows, the center of our brains is “overheating”...`  \n  \n`Which comes from our bad luck and limiting beliefs.`  \n  \n`It’s the root wave of stress…`\n\n>`And if this wave gets too “hot” it can lead to dementia, strokes, even sudden heart problems…`  \n  \n`All it takes to quiet down this signal of stress is 9-Word Script…`  \n  \n`And they’re revealing these findings in a brand new video:` [`https://freedom-man-wind.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-wealth-signal.html`](https://freedom-man-wind.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-wealth-signal.html)  `- The number of people who have seen concrete proof of real miracles is remarkable.`', 'author': 'RecognitionNovap', 'created_utc': 1729363826.0, 'score': 1, 'num_comments': 0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Material_Tao/comments/1g7fssa/neuroscience_wealth_strategy_a_review_of_trading/'}"

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'Best Soundbars?', 'content': ""When it comes to upgrading your home audio experience, choosing the right soundbar can make all the difference. Whether you're seeking immersive surround sound for movie nights, clear dialogue for TV shows, or rich bass for music, the options are vast and varied. Among the top contenders are the Sonos Arc, Bose Soundbar 700, Samsung HW-Q990C, LG S95QR, Vizio V Series, and JBL Bar 1300X. Each of these soundbars offers unique features and sound profiles, catering to different preferences and budgets, making it essential to find the one that best suits your needs.\n\n# 1.\xa0[Sonos Arc](https://amzn.to/3zYR8FX)\n\nThe Sonos Arc is widely regarded as one of the best soundbars on the market, particularly for its immersive sound quality and sleek design. It supports Dolby Atmos, which enhances the spatial audio experience, making it ideal for movies and music alike. The soundstage is expansive, with clear dialogue and rich bass. The integration with the Sonos ecosystem also allows for easy multi-room audio setup. However, it lacks a dedicated subwoofer, which some users might miss for deep bass.\n\n# 2.\xa0[Bose Soundbar 700](https://amzn.to/3BOqQ9Z)\n\nThe Bose Soundbar 700 is known for its premium build quality and sophisticated design. It delivers a well-balanced sound profile with clear dialogue and punchy bass. The ADAPTiQ audio calibration technology optimizes sound for your room's acoustics, enhancing the listening experience. It's also compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant, making it a smart addition to your home. However, it doesn't support Dolby Atmos, which might be a downside for those looking for the latest surround sound technology.\n\n# 3.\xa0[Samsung HW-Q990C](https://amzn.to/401TXRj)\n\nThe Samsung HW-Q990C is a powerhouse when it comes to sound performance. It features an 11.1.4 channel setup, including up-firing and side-firing speakers that create a truly immersive audio experience. With Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support, it delivers top-tier surround sound, especially when paired with a compatible Samsung TV. The bass is deep and impactful, thanks to the included subwoofer. The soundbar is also compatible with Samsung’s Q-Symphony technology, which synchronizes the soundbar with the TV’s speakers for a more expansive sound. It's a bit pricey but offers excellent value for those who prioritize sound quality.\n\n# 4.\xa0[LG S95QR](https://amzn.to/4eHC1zH)\n\nThe LG S95QR is a feature-rich soundbar that excels in delivering cinematic audio experiences. It supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X and includes up-firing speakers that enhance the sense of height in the soundstage. The soundbar comes with a wireless subwoofer and rear speakers, creating a 9.1.5 channel setup. The dialogue clarity is impressive, and the overall sound is powerful and immersive. It's also compatible with Google Assistant and Alexa, adding to its versatility. The only downside is that the setup can be a bit complex, especially with multiple components.\n\n# 5.\xa0[Vizio V Series](https://amzn.to/4eAOXaF)\n\nThe Vizio V Series soundbars are known for offering solid performance at an affordable price. They provide good sound quality for casual listening, with decent bass and clear dialogue. While they don’t support Dolby Atmos, they still deliver a respectable surround sound experience with DTS Virtual:X. The V Series is a great entry-level option for those who want to upgrade their TV’s audio without breaking the bank. However, the build quality and features are more basic compared to higher-end models.\n\n# 6.\xa0[JBL Bar 1300X](https://amzn.to/3BLjkN6)\n\nThe JBL Bar 1300X is a versatile soundbar that offers a robust sound profile with plenty of power. It includes detachable wireless surround speakers, which can be placed anywhere in the room for a more flexible setup. The soundbar supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, providing a rich and immersive audio experience. The bass is particularly strong, thanks to the included wireless subwoofer. Additionally, it has built-in voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant. However, the soundbar can be a bit bulky, and the detachable speakers may require frequent recharging.\n\nEach of these soundbars has its strengths, so your choice should depend on your specific needs, whether it's premium sound quality, immersive surround sound, smart features, or affordability."", 'author': 'QuestionOk9413', 'created_utc': 1729362266.0, 'score': 1, 'num_comments': 0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Top_product/comments/1g7f8hd/best_soundbars/'}"

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'Why Water Flossers Should Be Used With String Floss 💧 ', 'content': 'Why Water Flossers Aren’t a Complete Substitute for String Floss\n\nWater flossers have gained popularity for their ease of use and ability to reach hard-to-access areas in your mouth. While they are a great tool for many, they shouldn’t completely replace traditional string floss. Here’s why:\n\n1. Plaque Removal: String floss excels at scraping plaque off the sides of your teeth. This mechanical action is key in preventing cavities and gum disease. Water flossers, on the other hand, use a stream of water to flush out debris. While water flossers offer 99.9% plaque removal we still find that scraping the sides of each tooth is still recommended for caries management between the teeth especially with tight contacts. \n2. Tight Spaces: Some areas between your teeth are too tight for water flossers to clean effectively. String floss can be guided into these narrow spaces, ensuring a great clean.\n3. Gum Health: Water flossers are great for massaging your gums and improving circulation. They are the only floss that can reach up to 6mm into a deep periodontal pockets. Stimulating the gums with string floss in between the teeth ensures that you’re removing plaque and massaging gums right in between the teeth in hard to reach areas.\n4. Complementary Tools: Instead of seeing water flossers as a replacement, think of them as a complement to your oral care routine. Use both to enjoy the benefits of each. More and more research is released that shows when patients use a combination of flossing tools they get the best results!\n\nWhile water flossers can be a helpful addition to your daily oral hygiene they don’t fully replace the effectiveness of string floss. For a complete clean, keep both tools in your oral care toolkit!\n\n  \nHere are some ads to my favorites:\n\nExpanding string floss & Water flosser: [BurstOralCare.com](http://BurstOralCare.com) (StinaRDH for 25% off water flosser)\n\nWaterpik: [Waterpik Water Flosser](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GNVF7YI?ref=t_ac_view_request_product_image&campaignId=amzn1.campaign.1HGJO5YYMOSNC&linkCode=tr1&tag=stinardh-20&linkId=amzn1.campaign.1HGJO5YYMOSNC_1729355723085)\n\nPhilips Sonicare power Flosser: [https://amzn.to/4dOcYtL](https://amzn.to/4dOcYtL)\n\n  \nI’m here if you have any questions!

It’s decent, but not a game-changer.\n* **Type-C Charging Port**: Charging your devices while watching is neat.

Reddit,GOOGL,"{'title': 'Thoughts on the PLD?', 'content': ""Recently Straits Times got an article about PLD in the classroom, say very distracting, what are your thoughts, esp those w the PLD for 4 years already?\n\nHere are mine:\n\n1. PLDs are Poorly sanctioned\n→ MG is quite poorly used tbh, even before the whole scandal with the wiping of iPads in schools, I thought that MG was quite poorly sanctioned. I remember in S1, the way it would lock at night was that when you opened any website after 2200, the website would not display, but would redirect to MG website, prompting you to go sleep.\n\n→→ This is bad because: as the young immature child that was addicted to his devices that I was, I quickly found a way to still get entertainment even at night, just open a google docs document and load it with YouTube videos, you can watch them on google docs itself without opening another website. This continued until S2 when they changed to the fullscreen pop-up method.\n\n→→→ This is also rubbish, because I also quickly found out that if you put the PLD on sleep mode (I always do this with any computer) for a few days, MG's popup will magically just not appear after 2200. This continued until graduation.\n\n+ Apparently PLD is very easy to jailbreak, about 2 weeks before graduation I was going to the staff room to collect something and I passed by a guy, probably S1 or S2, running Genshin on his PLD, he looked at me and I looked at him. I could only clap for him.\n\n++ As someone that spends a lot of his time on discord because simply, not many people talk to me in school, ig or WhatsApp, somehow discord.com is blocked but ptb.discord.com was not blocked and accessible for most of the year until MG got removed??\n\n+++ In the final days of MG, that thing just started to block things randomly?? ChatGPT, YouTube, Geogebra etc were blocked after 2000 under some name I'm not familiar with, absolutely insane.\n\n2. Quality and system problems\n\n→ Unless you rarely touch the PLD, the computer cannot last more than 3 years. Yes, I understand that the Chromebook is the cheapest computer out there, and that were paying like 300~ SGD for a computer, which is really generous already given we're paying with edusave so I shouldn't expect top quality, but the PLD breaks down often. Often the system lags halfway me typing a document on it and whatever audio I'm playing in the background starts to lag and start repeating the previous 1 second like a broken recorder.\n\n→→ Perhaps I'm nitpicking here, but the screen also starts to have problems after 2 years, first bubbles start to form inside the screen with no way to remove them, then the screen starts to have black bars at the bottom before progressing to cover the whole screen. Just like cancer, but unfortunately by the time I wanted to repair it, I already used up my first repair on repairing a previous issue with the computer body, it broke after my classmate knocked on it and it fell on the floor.\n\n3. Rarely used in class\n\n→ Maybe it's just my school (graduated from a trash school in the west), but we rarely used the PLD, I'm not sure how it is in other schools, but we rarely used it over here. Many things still remain pen and paper, and on the rare occasion we do use the PLD, its always for trivial things like kahoot or group work on a Google docs that we can do on the phone.\n\n\n\nso yea thats about all my thoughts with the PLD, what are yours?"", 'author': 'myeovasari', 'created_utc': 1729399913.0, 'score': 1, 'num_comments': 2, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1g7r6iv/thoughts_on_the_pld/'}"

Reddit,GOOGL,"{'title': 'Time as a fabric', 'content': 'A conversation that’s been taking place on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/3YwzeUEXj7) is about how people feel afraid to be me. What that specifically means is, it seems I’m all over the place and doing all the things and people feel afraid that if they live like that, they will have too little free time. This is something I completely understand because I had mental drama about free time before I started my business too. Actually every time I switched companies I worried about free time because every time I interview for another job I’m pretty settled in the current job. Settled means knowing what the pattern of the day is going to be, it’s predictable. But when I don’t know what will happen in the future the cloud of vagueness makes it seem like any time can either be a free time or a busy time, and this variable time always tends to FEEL like busy time even when the possibility of it being free time is always available.\n\nSeen in this way how one views time is kind of related to how one views possibilities. When you’re the type of person who worries about stuff before things happen, it doesn’t matter how many good possibilities there are. Because all it takes is one droplet of bad possibility ink to color an entire ocean of good possibilities. This also shows us a severely binary kind of thinking, or more like a perfectionist way of thinking: even if 1000 good things happen, when 1 bad thing happens your day is ruined.\n\nWe view time like blocks with one color. I think this largely has to do with how society introduces children to time management. I don’t know if you’ve done this, but when I was growing up our schools made us create these pie charts that represent how we’re going to spend our time. So in that pie chart each slice represents what we’ll be doing in that time. Then we grow up and get introduced to school schedules, which are again blocks. Then we see Outlook or Google calendars and again, time is blocked off by blocks.\n\nIn the past I’ve tried other types of time management things. The most prominent one is the one I learned from the life coach school called Monday Hour One. The primary reason this strategy somewhat worked is because it resolved a key problem with time management: not knowing how much time to spend on something. Monday Hour One tries to solve this by spending the first hour of a Monday pre-dedicating blocks of time to tasks and regardless of how much progress you make, you just spend that much time. You repeatedly do this to get better guesstimates of your time usage over experience and before you know it you become a time master. It also engages your executive function by making you decide some things ahead of time and committing to them.\n\nBut if you’ve EVER been distracted before, and I’m willing to bet all of you reading this have been, you know that blocked time doesn’t necessarily mean one hour of pure focus time. One hour of blocked time is realistically about 15 minutes of getting something done and 45 minutes of bouncing around with different ideas (these numbers are heuristically derived from experience). In a Zoom meeting I frequently write some paragraphs of these writings and while I’m driving to jiujitsu I think of what I’m going to shoot as a short video on Instagram. When I’m doing jiujitsu I’m also socializing and talking to friends, and I’m also sharpening my video taking skills. Basically time, when actually spent, isn’t a block; it’s more like a finely woven fabric with different threads of consciousness.\n\nI developed my current time management with frequent experience of distractions. For me it starts at 5AM every day. The first hour of my day is spent with prayer but while it’s easy for people to think I shut off my brain and do nothing but bowing and meditating, in reality I’m thinking about all kinds of things during prayer (which motivates the need for training how to bring back focus). By the time I feed my dogs after walking them I have a clear idea of what I’m going to do for the day. But as I was writing this I realized that it goes deeper than that. I’m not really living NOW, I’m living a stream of time and I think *that* is the secret behind seeing time as a fabric.\n\nKind of like how I type so fast. When I’m typing I’m not focusing on the word I’m typing, I’m actually thinking of the next word to type while my body catches up. My consciousness is living in a flow of time and I’m just letting my body catch up and do the work. Being in the state of having one primary focus with many auxiliary foci prepares my body to do the next thing that’s ready. Similar to how a chef or a baker thinks. The prep and cleanup is constantly happening in the background and the next step of the recipe just happens when sufficient time has been spent in the previous step.\n\nBecause I allow myself to have so many concurrent thoughts at once and let my distractions freely roam around, they develop into more concrete ideas about how my time can be spent. And when the ideas are concrete enough to induce excitement out of me (following [The Action Formula](https://www.amazon.com/Action-Formula-inside-action-procrastination/dp/B0CJBFP91V)) I let it happen organically. The only true blocks of time I have are times dedicated to client work because it would be irresponsible of me to have someone pay me and spend time with me while I’m distracted. But at the same time this isn’t a problem because client work is something I’m always excited about.\n\nSeeing time as a fabric in summarized form is this.\n\n1. Accept and celebrate the fact that we’re always weaving multiple threads of consciousness.\n2. Trust that any of the threads of consciousness, when matured enough to generate excitement, will naturally lead to action. Kind of like trusting how leaving out milk in room temperature will eventually spoil it.\n3. When the momentum of action happens, fully ride it and capitalize on its energy. This is when the ability to execute really helps, and that ability is developed by voluntary, humanly possible challenges.\n\nThis is how chores and meetings and work and client sessions and jiujitsu and dog walking and writing and YouTube and sleep and travel can all happen. The more you do this, the more you get done in a single hour. Imagine and compare this. In one world you block out one hour and begrudgingly get one hour’s worth of work on one topic as an output. In another world you don’t block one hour but in differently paced spurts you get multiple hour’s worth of work in multiple topics as an output. Life is lived, not squeezed. Seeing times as blocks forces you to squeeze yourself to get value out of the time.\n\nI understand that this kind of paradigm shift requires a lot of trust in yourself. What if I’m always distracted on the wrong things? What if I just get lazy and don’t do anything? And to those questions I have one answer, if you’re daring: you’d be really, really fucking surprised by what happens when you truly let yourself be without criticism. I’d love it if you could just give yourself one week or month to truly let loose and do whatever the fuck you want in terms of your primal desires. You’ll learn a LOT about yourself and you’d find a new kind of motivation you’ve never experienced before: a willpower that is now temporarily quenched of its thirst of distractions.', 'author': 'julylifecoach', 'created_utc': 1729399860.0, 'score': 1, 'num_comments': 0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/u_julylifecoach/comments/1g7r61a/time_as_a_fabric/'}"

He has over 20 years of experience in user-centered design.  \n\nJeremy leads a team of conversion-focused experts who specialize in creating tightly engineered websites and sales funnels that effortlessly convert clicks into customers. \n\n What sets Jeremy’s web design agency apart from the competition is their unique money-back guarantee. Unlike many web design agencies who are experts in MSU (making stuff up) and regularly cut corners at clients’ expenses (but to their quick payday), Jeremy guarantees his work.  \n\nOne of the reasons why Jeremy can stand behind his work is because his team only implements strategies for their clients after they’ve been thoroughly tested and proven to produce consistent results. \n\n Jeremy McGilvrey’s web design agency is committed to delivering exceptional service to their clients.
