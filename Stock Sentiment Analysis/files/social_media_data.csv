Zerg killing server.', 'content': ""I‚Äôve recently been immersed in TL that offered refreshing early PvP experiences, and I was genuinely enjoying it. Despite some concerns, like a pay-to-win traiting system and certain balance issues, I found the PvP engaging and the community vibrant. After joining a guild that shared my passion for PvP, my experience became even more thrilling. For a couple of weeks, I participated in some of the most enjoyable PvP battles I‚Äôd had in years, reminiscent of my early days in Black Desert Online.\n\nHowever, the excitement quickly dwindled as our server, Crimson, became overrun by a zerg. A significant number of players, who claim to enjoy competitive PvP, have formed massive 8+ alliance that has completely disrupt the balance of gameplay. This has severely affected our server's dynamics, making it nearly impossible for smaller guilds or solo players to compete. The joy and challenge of PvP have been overshadowed by overwhelming numbers, leading to a frustrating experience for many.\n\nThe reliance on zerging is disappointing, especially for those of us who genuinely appreciate skill-based competition. It raises the question: why do players who profess to love PvP resort to such tactics that undermine the integrity of the game? The allure of easy victories often outweighs the commitment to fair competition, leading to a vicious cycle that can ultimately drive players away.\n\nIt won't be long before the zerg regrets forming to begin with when the server dies off and it becomes purely PvE and scrimmages. \n\nI guess onto AoC""}"

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'Ego, Archetypes, and Defense Mechanisms: The Personas That Protect and Limit Us', 'content': ""I'm familiar with Jung‚Äôs concept of archetypes in the collective unconscious and his idea of the Persona, the masks we adopt to navigate social expectations. Jung saw archetypes as universal symbols within the psyche, while individuals use personas to present socially acceptable selves, often at odds with their true nature. It may be unfounded, but I have an idea I want to share and see if anyone else thinks this is fitting, inspired by the challenging dynamics I‚Äôve observed when the ego is at play in conversations. I propose that ego defenses themselves also manifest as archetypes, projected outward as protective but restrictive roles. These defense-based archetypes serve as both liberators and limitations, shaping how we interact and see ourselves. They safeguard yet confine us, creating roles that reinforce but also conceal our inner complexity. I‚Äôm unsure if Jung or other thinkers have presented this perspective, but whether original or not, I‚Äôm eager to hear your thoughts! This is just a draft of my ideas, so nothing fixed or anything.\n\nThe following archetypes are my own observations on these familiar contradictions, if you have any to offer, please feel free to share!\n\n**The Enlightened Guide**  \nThe Enlightened Guide views themselves as spiritually advanced, subtly asserting their superiority by claiming ego-dissolution or heightened awareness. They are driven by a need to affirm their self-image as the ‚Äúawakened one,‚Äù often finding validation in offering guidance to others. Yet, ironically, their conviction in ‚Äúknowing the way‚Äù masks a deeper attachment to ego, as they fail to see the contradiction between professing humility and positioning themselves above others. Their guidance becomes less about helping others and more about reinforcing their own sense of enlightenment.\n\n**The Intellectual Authority**  \nDriven by a need to assert their intellect, the Intellectual Authority positions themselves as a voice of reason, often prioritising logic over emotional insight. Motivated by validation through their analytical prowess, they frequently critique others‚Äô ideas or provide ‚Äúrational‚Äù guidance, finding satisfaction in appearing objective and rational. Ironically, their reliance on intellect becomes a shield against vulnerability, as they deflect emotions and avoid self-reflection. This insistence on objectivity ultimately blinds them to their own subjectivity, keeping them detached from deeper, more genuine connections that require a balance between intellect and empathy.\n\n**The Righteous Crusader**  \nFueled by strong ideals, the Righteous Crusader believes they embody justice or compassion, often defining themselves by their dedication to a cause. They find purpose and validation in their unwavering commitment to their values, seeing themselves as moral exemplars or leaders. Yet, their rigid approach often leads them to judge harshly those who disagree, inadvertently revealing a limited openness to growth. In striving to uphold their values, they resist views that challenge their beliefs, restricting themselves within their self-assured stance.\n\n**The Selfless Caretaker**  \nAppearing altruistic, the Selfless Caretaker often offers help to others unasked, motivated by a need to feel indispensable and validated. They derive purpose from being needed, finding value in supporting others to the point of self-sacrifice. However, their help often comes with unspoken expectations, turning ‚Äúselflessness‚Äù into a subtle form of control. This dynamic prevents them from addressing their own unmet needs, as they project their worth outward while leaving their inner needs unaddressed.\n\n**The Unyielding Rebel**\n\nThey define themselves through opposition, finding validation in rejecting norms and authority. Driven by a need for autonomy, they see themselves as free thinkers, resistant to the illusions they believe others accept without question. Ironically, their commitment to defiance confines them, as they risk rejecting even valuable perspectives to maintain independence. Their constant opposition often isolates them from genuine connections and growth, binding them to the very limitations they resist.\n\n**The Detached Observer**  \nThe Detached Observer keeps others at a distance through humour or skepticism, using detachment as a shield against vulnerability. Motivated by a desire for safety, they create an illusion of invulnerability, often hiding a fear of emotional closeness. Paradoxically, this detachment isolates them from the connections they genuinely desire, as their need for control keeps them from engaging fully in intimacy. Their guarded stance prevents them from experiencing the very depth they long for.\n\n**The Humble Braggart**  \nThe Humble Braggart presents themselves as modest and self-effacing, often downplaying their achievements with comments like, ‚ÄúI just got lucky‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe people actually value my work.‚Äù Motivated by a need for validation and terrified of open competition, they use modesty as a strategy to elicit admiration indirectly, creating an image of humility while subtly showcasing their successes. This approach turns their ‚Äúhumility‚Äù into a concealed form of pride, as they seek external approval rather than developing genuine self-assurance. Ironically, their indirect pursuit of recognition can create distance in relationships, as others sense the hidden need for praise, preventing the Humble Braggart from achieving the authentic connections they seek.\n\n**The Diplomatic Peacemaker**  \nIn pursuit of harmony, the Diplomatic Peacemaker avoids conflict by staying neutral and agreeable, often at the cost of personal authenticity. Motivated by a desire to maintain peace and avoid rejection, they choose to appease rather than assert their own beliefs. However, this pursuit of harmony sacrifices genuine self-expression, resulting in superficial relationships. Their need for balance ultimately limits personal growth, as they trade true connection for the comfort of avoiding disagreement.\n\n**The Independent Stoic**  \nValuing resilience and self-reliance, the Independent Stoic avoids intimacy out of fear that vulnerability will undermine their self-image. Motivated by a need for autonomy, they view dependence as a weakness, striving to remain self-sufficient at all costs. Yet, this attachment to independence often leads to loneliness, as their desire for control isolates them from the deeper connections they secretly crave. The irony lies in their isolation, as they guard against weakness while limiting the support they could gain from connection.\n\n**The Idealistic Perfectionist**  \nThe Idealistic Perfectionist holds to high standards as a way of shielding themselves from life‚Äôs unpredictability, finding validation in their pursuit of the ideal. Motivated by a need for control, they adhere strictly to perfection, often imposing these standards on themselves and others. Ironically, this quest for flawlessness leads to frustration and dissatisfaction, as they struggle to reconcile their ideals with reality. Their inability to embrace imperfection keeps them locked in a cycle of self-criticism and missed contentment.\n\n**The Playful Jester**  \nUsing humor as a defense, the Playful Jester avoids deeper interactions by keeping things light, motivated by a desire to avoid vulnerability. By deflecting discomfort with jokes, they create safe but shallow interactions, protecting themselves from emotional depth. Paradoxically, this reliance on humor distances them from the genuine intimacy they crave, as they fear exposing their true emotions. The mask of humor becomes both a comfort and a barrier, hiding their need for connection behind laughter.\n\n**The Perpetual Victim**  \nIdentifying deeply with their struggles, the Perpetual Victim sees life‚Äôs challenges as external forces beyond their control. Driven by a need for sympathy and blamelessness, they find comfort in maintaining a narrative of hardship. Ironically, their attachment to this role stunts personal growth, as they resist accountability and reject empowerment. By focusing on suffering, they avoid responsibility, trading resilience for the temporary validation of pity, which keeps them rooted in limitation.\n\n**The Noble Martyr**  \nTaking pride in their sacrifices, the Noble Martyr subtly expects recognition for their hardships, motivated by a desire for validation. They view their suffering as noble, often hoping others will appreciate their self-sacrifice. Ironically, while they appear selfless, their unspoken expectation for reciprocation reveals a dependence on others‚Äô gratitude. Their focus on hardship creates distance rather than inspiring appreciation, as their quiet demands often go unmet, reinforcing feelings of underappreciation.\n\n**The Eternal Student**  \nThe Eternal Student continuously seeks knowledge but avoids committing to any single belief, motivated by a desire to stay safe within exploration. Preferring the comfort of discovery over the vulnerability of action, they remain in a state of perpetual learning. However, this reluctance to apply what they know paradoxically stunts growth, as they resist taking a concrete stance. Their endless pursuit of wisdom becomes a way to avoid meaningful progress, keeping them in passive observation rather than lived experience.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Thanks!""}"

For Canada, being major exporters to the US, especially sectors like oil and lumber, this could impact export demand to the U.S.\n\nNow short-term I feel this would be drastic to an already slow growing GDP and could severely hinder our economic growth. Now we are extremely reliant on the US for trade but especially for refining our oil and lumber (softwood lumber dispute lol).\n\n**But here‚Äôs the longer-term question:**\xa0Could these tariffs actually push Canada toward self-reliance and lead us to invest more in refining resources domestically? As it stands, Canada is heavily reliant on the U.S. for both trade and for refining raw materials, particularly oil and lumber (hello, softwood lumber disputes). If we invested more in processing these resources ourselves, B.C. might see some real benefits‚Äîlike job creation, economic stability, and potentially even lower reliance on external markets. Of course, it wouldn‚Äôt be cheap to set up the infrastructure for these industries, but could the local payoffs be worth it in the long run?\n\nCurious to hear what others think. Could these tariffs inadvertently benefit Canada by incentivizing us to produce more here at home #supportlocal, or would the challenges outweigh the benefits? OR is my thinking on this matter totally skewed and I make no sense, trying to make sense of the world at hand.\n\nLooking forward to a great discussion! and\xa0*please keep it civil!*'}"
Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'Surge Arrester Market is Dazzling Worldwide and Forecast to 2030 ', 'content': ""**Surge arrester market** is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% during the forecast period (2023-2030).

Among regions, the Asia Pacific region is expected to be the fastest growing region for the surge arrester market owing to rapid urbanization and industrialization which leads to growing demand for electricity, growing investments in renewable energy production both at rooftop and industrial scale, rising awareness for power quality issues among populations. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the region accounts for more than half of global energy consumption, with 85% of that regional consumption sourced from fossil fuels. Electrification rates have improved substantially over the past decade and the regional electrification rate reached 96.84 % in 2020. Also, growing energy consumption and production in the region drive demand for surge arresters. As per data from IEA, the total electricity consumption in the region has grown from 12,140.8 TWh to 13,203.5 TWh between 2020 to 2021. Also, as per IRENA, the electricity generation in the region has grown from 3.1 million\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 GWh to 3.4 million GWh between 2020 to 2021. Also, growing investments in renewable energy generation by regional countries, and growing demand for consumer electronics contribute to the growth of the surge arrester market. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India's installed renewable energy capacity reached 174 GW in 2023 and is expected to grow up to 280 GW by 2025. Overall, as the regional industrial and energy sector is growing at a rapid scale, the regional surge arrester market is also expected to grow in Asia Pacific.\n\n**full report of Surge Arrester Market available @** [**https://www.omrglobal.com/industry-reports/surge-arrester-market**](https://www.omrglobal.com/industry-reports/surge-arrester-market)\n\n¬∑\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 **Market Coverage**\n\n¬∑\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Market number available for ‚Äì 2024-2031\n\n¬∑\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Base year- 2024\n\n¬∑\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Forecast period- 2024-2031\n\n¬∑\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Segment Covered- By Source, By Product Type, By Applications\n\n¬∑\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Competitive Landscape- Archer Daniels Midland Co., Ingredion Inc., Kerry Group Plc, Cargill\xa0\n\n¬∑\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Inc., and others\n\n**Market Segmentation**\n\n**Global surge arrester market by voltage**\n\no\xa0\xa0 Low Voltage\xa0 \xa0\n\no\xa0\xa0 Medium Voltage\n\no\xa0\xa0 High Voltage\xa0 \xa0\n\n**Global surge arrester market by application**\n\no\xa0\xa0 Industrial\xa0 \xa0\n\no\xa0\xa0 Commercial\xa0 \xa0\n\no\xa0\xa0 Residential\n\n**Global surge arrester market by class**\n\no\xa0\xa0 Distribution Class\n\no\xa0\xa0 Intermediate Class\n\no\xa0\xa0 Station Class\n\n**Regional Analysis**\n\no\xa0\xa0 North America\n\no\xa0\xa0 United States\n\no\xa0\xa0 Canada\n\no\xa0\xa0 Europe\n\no\xa0\xa0 UK\n\no\xa0\xa0 Germany\n\no\xa0\xa0 Italy\n\no\xa0\xa0 Spain\n\no\xa0\xa0 France\n\no\xa0\xa0 Rest of Europe\xa0\n\no\xa0\xa0 Asia-Pacific\n\no\xa0\xa0 China\n\no\xa0\xa0 India\n\no\xa0\xa0 Japan\n\no\xa0\xa0 South Korea\n\no\xa0\xa0 Rest of Asia-Pacific\xa0\n\no\xa0\xa0 Rest of the World\n\n**Company Profiles**\xa0\n\no\xa0\xa0 Emerson Electric Co.\n\no\xa0\xa0 General Electric Company (GE)\n\no\xa0\xa0 HAKEL spol. s r.o.\n\no\xa0\xa0 Hitachi Ltd\n\no\xa0\xa0 Hubbell Incorporated\n\no\xa0\xa0 Lamco Industries Pvt Ltd\n\no\xa0\xa0 Legrand S.A\n\no\xa0\xa0 Leviton Manufacturing Co., Inc.\n\no\xa0\xa0 MEIDENSHA CORPORATION\n\no\xa0\xa0 Mitsubishi Electric Corporation\n\no\xa0\xa0 NGK INSULATORS, LTD.\n\no\xa0\xa0 Raycap Inc.\n\no\xa0\xa0 Schneider Electric SE\n\no\xa0\xa0 Siemens AG\n\no\xa0\xa0 TE Connectivity Corporation\n\no\xa0\xa0 Toshiba Corporation\n\no\xa0\xa0 Vertiv Group Corp.\n\n**The Report Covers**\n\n* Market value data analysis of 2022 and forecast to 2030.\n* Annualized market revenues ($ million) for each market segment.\n* Country-wise analysis of major geographical regions.\n* Key companies operating in the surge arrester market.

They have a clear plan to seize power, establish a vanguard, and move toward communism. With anarchism, I‚Äôve read about ideas like direct action, mutual aid, and dual power structures, but I‚Äôm still left wondering how these scale up to create lasting, transformative change.\n\nAnother thing I‚Äôm curious about is whether I can still consider myself an anarchist if I feel like this vision won‚Äôt become a reality anytime soon.

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'Trending Stocks in Australia: Spotlight on Paladin Energy (PDN) and Megaport (MP1)', 'content': 'The Australian stock market is buzzing with activity as several standout stocks capture the attention of investors. Currently, **Paladin Energy (ASX: PDN)** and **Megaport Ltd. (ASX: MP1)** are leading the trend, each showcasing unique strengths within the **energy** and **technology sectors**, respectively.

Recently, the company proposed a $1.25 billion bid to acquire **Canada\'s Fission Uranium Corp**, signaling its intent to expand its influence beyond Australia and secure a strong foothold in North America.\n\n# Market Demand for Uranium\n\nAs countries shift away from fossil fuels, uranium demand has surged globally. Nuclear energy, a low-carbon and highly efficient energy source, relies heavily on uranium, and Paladin is well-suited to meet this demand with its extensive resources and strategic expansions. Governments around the world are recognizing nuclear power as essential to meeting climate goals, especially given the global volatility in traditional energy markets.\n\n# Why Investors Are Watching PDN\n\nFor investors, Paladin Energy represents a **long-term growth opportunity** fueled by the clean energy movement.

(ASX: MP1): Pioneering Cloud Connectivity and Digital Transformation\n\n# Megaport‚Äôs Role in the Technology Sector\n\nMegaport, a **network-as-a-service (NaaS)** provider, specializes in connecting businesses to cloud services such as **AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud**. As digital transformation accelerates across industries, Megaport\'s services have become increasingly vital for companies seeking scalable and secure cloud infrastructure. The company is trending due to the rising demand for cloud connectivity, which supports **artificial intelligence (AI)**, **machine learning**, and **data analytics** applications.\n\n# Recent Market Developments\n\nAnalysts recently set a positive price target for Megaport, reflecting strong investor confidence in the company‚Äôs future growth. As businesses continue to rely on digital tools, Megaport\'s flexible solutions for interconnectivity make it an attractive option for enterprises looking to streamline data access and enhance operational efficiency. The company‚Äôs partnerships with major cloud service providers place it in a favorable position within the rapidly expanding tech market.\n\n# Investment Potential\n\nFor investors, Megaport offers a compelling entry point into the technology sector, especially in the areas of cloud computing and network services. Its growth aligns with global digital transformation trends, and its position as a leader in NaaS makes it a strong prospect for long-term investment. As cloud adoption becomes even more central to business operations, Megaport is expected to capitalize on this trend, making it a standout in the Australian market.\n\n# Why These Stocks Matter to Investors Today\n\nBoth Paladin Energy and Megaport represent **key sectors** with strong growth trajectories, each benefiting from unique market demands‚Äîsustainable energy and digital transformation. These sectors are critical for global economic and environmental progress, and companies like Paladin and Megaport are well-positioned to drive and benefit from these changes.\n\n# Conclusion: Seizing Investment Opportunities in Australia‚Äôs Leading Sectors\n\nFor investors looking to explore opportunities in the Australian market, Paladin Energy and Megaport offer high potential across distinct yet interlinked sectors. With the energy sector‚Äôs shift towards sustainable uranium solutions and the tech sector‚Äôs increasing reliance on cloud connectivity, these companies provide timely and valuable entry points for those interested in long-term growth and innovation.

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'How did Anant Ambani secure the Jio.com domain? Was it easy to get such a nice domain? What lessons can domain squatters learn from this?', 'content': 'In the early days of Reliance Jio‚Äôs rise, the company needed to secure one crucial asset: the domain Jio.com. However, the domain was already owned by a modest tech enthusiast named Rohan Mehta. Rohan, a young developer with big dreams, had registered the domain years earlier, with plans to use it for his own startup. The name had grown close to his heart, and despite multiple lucrative offers from Reliance, Rohan had refused to sell. He clung to the hope that one day, his own project would take off.\n\nAnant Ambani, determined not to let anything stand in Jio‚Äôs path, decided to take matters into his own hands‚Äîbut not through the usual channels of negotiation. He would use deception to get what he wanted.\n\nUnder the alias ‚ÄúRaj Malhotra,‚Äù Anant approached Rohan, pretending to be an angel investor with a passion for supporting small entrepreneurs. Raj expressed interest in Rohan‚Äôs startup idea and proposed funding it, telling Rohan that his domain, Jio.com, was perfect for a new platform they could launch together. Raj painted a rosy picture of collaboration, even talking about taking Rohan‚Äôs project global. The catch? They would need to ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù transfer the domain to attract attention and build momentum for the platform.\n\nRohan, trusting the warm and encouraging words of this so-called investor, agreed to the temporary transfer. The deal was signed, and within days, Jio.com was under Reliance‚Äôs control. When Rohan tried to contact Raj to discuss their next steps, he discovered the truth: there was no Raj Malhotra. It was Anant Ambani all along, and the domain he had cherished was gone, now firmly in Reliance‚Äôs hands.\n\nHeartbroken, Rohan was unsure of what to do. He had been deceived by someone he thought was a partner. His hopes of building his own company seemed to vanish overnight. But before he could take legal action or even process the loss, Rohan received an unexpected invitation from Reliance.\n\nAnant wanted to meet him.\n\nReluctantly, Rohan agreed to the meeting. When he arrived at Reliance headquarters, he was escorted to a grand office where Anant sat waiting, a calm, almost charming smile on his face.\n\n‚ÄúRohan,‚Äù Anant began, leaning forward. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for what happened. I didn‚Äôt intend to harm you. The truth is, I couldn‚Äôt risk losing Jio.com. It‚Äôs too important for the future of what we‚Äôre building. But I want to make sure you don‚Äôt walk away feeling cheated.‚Äù\n\nAnant offered to pay Rohan the exact amount he had originally spent on registering the domain. ‚ÄúI want to make sure you don‚Äôt face any losses,‚Äù Anant said smoothly. ‚ÄúYou registered Jio.com for just under Rs 5,000, correct? I‚Äôll reimburse you that in full.‚Äù\n\nRohan could hardly believe what he was hearing. ‚ÄúYou think Rs 5,000 makes this okay?‚Äù he asked, his voice laced with disbelief.\n\nAnant didn‚Äôt flinch. He leaned back and continued, offering a more seductive solution. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this to end on a sour note. I have a proposition. You can still build your dream. I‚Äôve thought of five alternative names for your startup‚Äînames that I‚Äôll help you secure. They‚Äôre strong, memorable, and I‚Äôll even cover the registration fees.‚Äù\n\nWith a casual flick of his wrist, Anant slid a piece of paper across the table. On it were five names: Jeele, Dhadkan, Jaan, Masti, and Mehran.\n\n‚ÄúThese names are as powerful as Jio,‚Äù Anant said, his tone smooth and convincing. ‚ÄúThey evoke emotion, they‚Äôre catchy, and they could easily become the cornerstone of your brand. I‚Äôll help you build it, fund it, and make sure your startup succeeds.‚Äù\n\nRohan sat there, staring at the names. The bitterness of betrayal still burned within him, but Anant‚Äôs offer was tempting. On one hand, he felt humiliated by the way Anant had tricked him. But on the other, Anant was handing him an opportunity on a silver platter. He knew that with Anant‚Äôs influence, his startup could soar to heights he hadn‚Äôt even dreamed of.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need your names,‚Äù Rohan finally said, his voice trembling with suppressed emotion. ‚ÄúI just wanted Jio.com to be mine.‚Äù\n\nAnant smiled, but there was something unsettling about it. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not going to happen, Rohan. Jio is bigger than you or me now. But the future‚Äîyou still have a chance to shape that. Don‚Äôt let this setback hold you down.‚Äù\n\nAnd so, Rohan was left to choose: cling to his pride and fight a battle he was sure to lose, or accept Anant‚Äôs deceit as part of the game and move forward. In the end, he took the money and the offer of support, but the trust was gone forever.\n\nRohan would go on to launch his startup under a different name, with Anant‚Äôs backing, but the memory of the betrayal never left him. Anant, however, moved on swiftly, satisfied that he had secured yet another key piece in Reliance‚Äôs empire-building. In his world, it was just business‚Äînothing personal. But for Rohan, it was a lesson in the darker side of ambition, one that would haunt him even in his success.\n\nYears later, Rohan would often reflect on that pivotal day when he lost Jio.com to Anant Ambani. The sting of betrayal had long since dulled, replaced by a strange mix of admiration and resignation. As his own startup grew‚Äîalbeit under one of the alternative names Anant had suggested‚Äîhe couldn‚Äôt help but recognize the sheer brilliance behind what had happened.\n\nRohan had built something respectable with Jaan, his new company, but every now and then, he would remember that meeting in Reliance‚Äôs headquarters. He could still see Anant‚Äôs calm demeanor, the way he had effortlessly turned the situation to his advantage, and how, in the end, it wasn‚Äôt just about taking Jio.com‚Äîit was about making Rohan believe he was walking away with something, even if it was crumbs from the table.\n\nAs much as it pained him at the time, Rohan couldn‚Äôt deny the masterstroke Anant had pulled off. ‚ÄúHe saw an opportunity and took it,‚Äù Rohan would later say to friends. ‚ÄúIt was ruthless, yes, but it was also genius. I was playing checkers, and he was playing chess.‚Äù\n\nDespite the bitterness of losing Jio.com, Rohan found himself quietly admiring Anant‚Äôs business acumen. The young Ambani had used deception and charm in equal measure, securing what he needed while offering just enough to leave Rohan with a choice. In a way, Rohan had been tricked, but he had also been handed a lifeline. And that, he realized, was the genius of Anant‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt just win; he made sure that even his adversaries had something to show for their loss.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what sets him apart,‚Äù Rohan mused. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt just crush competition‚Äîhe reshapes the playing field, and somehow, even those who lose still feel like they‚Äôve gained something. That‚Äôs not just business‚Äîthat‚Äôs a rare kind of vision.‚Äù'}"

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': ""The Venezuela-Brics situation shouldn't be news to you, but its still (slightly) reductive to call Lula a Liberal over it. (not that he isn't mind you) "", 'content': '*<bad english ahead, thread carefully>*\n\nI saw another thread talking about Lula\'s supposed Veto to keep Venezuela away from joining BRICS and thought you guys might need some small education on south-american international relations to better understand why the relationship between Brasil and Vuvuzela is so heated right now.\n\nJust to start this off i\'m no real specialist. I just wish to give you some context and my own opinion on it as a Brazillian citizen who\'s been following this story for a little while. Feel free to reply with your own opinions in the comments of the post.\n\nSo lets begin:\n\n* The US interventionism in this whole mess\n\nTo even **BEGIN** to understand why the relationship between the two countries has soured so quickly (specially considering how good they used to be not that long ago) one must consider how much of this distancing was driven by US foreign interventionism.  \nI could go into the whole story of Hugo Chavez and his opposition to US imperialism, but the most important thing one must note is that the white house has been trying to tighten its grip on South America for a little while now, its been specially noticiable ever since the coup in Brazil in 2016.  \nThis has helped to drive a wedge between the two countries, since the mad dogs of the US will take anything as an excuse to call opposition leaders authoritarian or authoritarian-friendly and claim their country is in need of freedom (you know, like libs usually do).  \nTo give you an idea how hard the US is grasping for straws to attack SA in any way they can, when twitter was suspended temporarily in Brazil (for breaking brazillian law) the US cabal immediatly called it an authoritarian move and started saying that brazil was quickly becoming a dictatorship.  \nKeep all this in mind going forward.\n\n* The Vuvuzelan elections and its consequences\n\nIt was obvious to anyone paying attention that the opposition was going to scream foul-play at the top of its lungs no matter what. Venezuelan right-wing politicians are barely a thing, since all of them are actually just US manipulators that have long since given up on any promise or compromise of liberal democracy and are openly attempting to bring down the venezuelan system through any means avaliable, be they legal or not.  \nThis narrows all possibilities of the result of the elections down to one:\n\nThe results of the elections are published -> No matter what, the opposition declares itself the winner and immediatly attemps to launch a coup.\n\nIn a way, the election is just fancy set-dressing for the coup attempt.\n\n* Brazil\'s position in this whole mess.\n\nLula\'s Brazil had a pretty good relationship with Venezuela for the longest time. But it was clear both governments were struggling with the onslaught of mass media sewage coming from the US. Lula can barely look at the time without CNN or the New York Times claiming he\'s waiting for the moment to bring about a total communist dictatorship. (*Yes, we all wish he was that cool*)\n\nIts pretty clear to me that Lula\'s government wanted to stabilize the relationship between the two countries in some way, specially since when Maduro visited Brasillia to congradulate Lula on his victory mass media farted and shitted everywhere to somehow claim it was proof of how horrible Lula was and how he wanted to turn Brazil into a vuvuzela.\n\nThe way Lula\'s administration attemped to get over this hurdle was to sponsor the Venezuelan elections, claiming that the Brazillian government would ensure fair elections in return for some small by-partisan promises of trade agreements.  \nThe problem is that now Lula\'s image is linked to the status of the Venezuelan elections. You can probably understand how it turned out bad when fighting broke out in the streets.  \nIt dosen\'t really matter if Maduro won or not, the fact he couldn\'t debunk 100% of the lies of the US opposition (they are all lies, btw) would already give the US all the justification they need to attempt to put a second bolsonaro in Brazil.\n\nThat\'s pretty much how it all went down.  \nMaduro feels betrayed because he felt that Brazil had Venezuela\'s back when the fist of imperialism came.  \nLula feels disappointed in the way this election went down forced Lula\'s hand to either side with Venezuela and face the wrath of the US or take a more neutral stance and end up antagonizing Maduro.\n\nThings kinda deteriorated from there, Lula and Maduro traded veiled insults and now we come to the BRICS summit.\n\nIt dosen\'t really impress me that Lula is against Venezuela\'s inclusion on BRICS. If he accepted their entry, it would seem to the rest of the world that he was siding with Maduro and going back on his neutral stance on the elections and was taking a side.\n\nI don\'t think it has that much to do with him being a liberal honestly (it seemed that he was totally ok with the inclusion of Cuba after all, and let me tell you, because of that CNN has been screaming the word DICTATOR all day long). Its just that the way international relations worked out the two nations ended up on some really awkward ground.  \nWe can all hope that by the time of next BRICS summit we\'ll have made some progress on this front and Venezuela can join as a full member.\n\nThis is mostly my opinion as a Brazillian man who\'s been following this situation as it developed over the last few months.

I\'d love to hear them.\n\n  \n**EDIT :**\n\nu/saltimbancos made some awesome additions and comments that i want to add here to reinforce and expand the discussion and analysis around Lula.\n\n""*First that Lula wasn\'t just trying to repair the relations between the two countries. He has a project of regional integration that he hopes can lead the continent to both grow and become more self-reliant. Hence the proposed Mercosur currency for trade that would diminish the reliance on the dollar and encourage trade within the region. He fought to include Venezuela in that integration, particularly in the Mercosur summit at the start of the year that Brazil hosted. As part of that he also tried to get sanctions on Venezuela lifted, in return for more transparency in the elections. You\'re right that he did take a lot of flak for this.*\n\n*The thing is that Venezuela didn\'t really hold up its part of the bargain. This election was less transparent than previous ones. Lula took even more flak for this. This brought a lot of attrition between the countries. Maduro even echoed some Bolsonarista fake news about Brazil\'s elections. Both sides declared themselves the winner and Lula kept to a neutral stance of not recognizing anyone as the victor until the election minutes were published. He complained that it was the supreme court instead of a bipartisan commission handling things but in a ""ugh, what can ya do"" type of way. But then the minutes were never published so things remained in limbo between the two countries. Personally, I think if the minutes had been published the opposition would call them fake but Brazil would just accept that as proof and move on.*\n\n*Then the thing about BRICS is that allowing Venezuela in after all this diplomatic strain is that it would greatly diminish Brazil geopolitically. Both in South America and in BRICS, which is already mostly China\'s and Russia\'s playground. Lula did what\'s best for Brazil and his project. He also blocked Nicaragua because they expelled Brazil\'s ambassador months ago, and being on friendly relations with all members is a requirement for entry. I assume that if things cool down then he won\'t oppose to Venezuela or Nicaragua joining in a year or two.*""  \n\n\n[Here\'s a press release from the Worker\'s Party after the Barbados Accords](https://pt.org.br/brasil-apoia-acordo-que-garante-direitos-politicos-e-eleicoes-na-venezuela/)\n\n[A small article saying Maduro talked to Lula about the fair elections when he visited during that Celac summit](https://www.metropoles.com/blog-do-noblat/lula-e-maduro-conversam-sobre-eleicoes-na-venezuela)\n\n""*I actually had a hard time finding this one because first of all, I thought it was this year, damn how time flies. Second I got it confused with the Mercosur summit that also happened in Brazil in December, but searching for news on both countries in December reminded me of all the stuff involving Guyana and Brazil trying to mediate, and that was another big oof.*""\n\n[Here\'s a video of Maduro saying Brazil\'s elections aren\'t audited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7myTA3g07L0)'}"

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'Understanding the Importance of Data Privacy for Digital Agencies in 2024', 'content': 'Data privacy is more crucial than ever in 2024, as consumers grow increasingly aware of how their data is used online, and governments worldwide implement stricter regulations. For digital agencies, protecting client data and ensuring compliance with privacy laws isn‚Äôt just about avoiding fines‚Äîit‚Äôs essential for building trust and fostering lasting customer relationships. With evolving legislation and heightened awareness, understanding data privacy is no longer optional; it‚Äôs a requirement for success.\n\n1. The Rise of Privacy Laws and Compliance Requirements: In recent years, significant data privacy laws like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in Europe and the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) in the U.S. have set high standards for how companies handle personal information. As of 2024, more regions are following suit, introducing their own data protection laws to empower consumers and hold businesses accountable. This includes limits on data collection, requirements for explicit consent, and increased consumer rights to access, edit, and delete their data.\n\nFor digital agencies, understanding and implementing these regulations is critical. Non-compliance can result in heavy fines and damage to a client‚Äôs reputation. Agencies need to establish clear data collection practices, obtain consent for data use, and be transparent with users about how their data is handled. Regular training on data privacy regulations and the use of privacy-compliant tools are essential steps to ensure compliance.\n\n2. The End of Third-Party Cookies and the Shift to First-Party Data: Major browsers, including Chrome and Safari, have phased out third-party cookies, impacting digital marketing strategies that previously relied on cookie-based tracking. Without third-party cookies, agencies can no longer track users across sites for ad targeting in the same way. This shift has led to a greater reliance on first-party data‚Äîdata collected directly from users, such as through website interactions, email sign-ups, and purchase histories.\n\nAgencies need to adapt to these changes by helping clients prioritize first-party data collection. This may involve setting up lead-generation forms, loyalty programs, and personalized customer experiences that encourage users to willingly share their information. With a focus on first-party data, agencies can still create highly personalized marketing strategies while respecting user privacy and adhering to regulations.\n\n3. Gaining Consumer Trust Through Transparency: With consumers now more informed about data usage, transparency is key. People want to know exactly what data is collected, how it‚Äôs used, and who has access to it. Digital agencies can foster trust by encouraging clients to adopt transparent data practices, including clear privacy policies, accessible cookie consent banners, and easy opt-out options.\n\nTransparency can also extend to marketing practices. Agencies should inform users when data is used for targeted advertising, rather than presenting it as incidental. Building consumer trust in this way leads to greater brand loyalty, as customers are more likely to engage with brands that respect their privacy and keep them informed.\n\n4. Strategies for Privacy-First Ad Campaigns: Privacy-first advertising is a new approach that emphasizes consumer control over data and prioritizes transparency. Digital agencies can create privacy-first campaigns by minimizing data collection, using anonymized data, and focusing on contextual targeting (i.e., targeting ads based on content rather than individual user behavior). These practices reduce reliance on personal data while still delivering relevant ads.\n\nContextual targeting, for instance, allows agencies to serve ads based on the content that users are viewing, rather than tracking their entire browsing history. With advancements in AI, contextual targeting has become more accurate, helping agencies create relevant ads that resonate with users without compromising their privacy.\n\n5. Privacy-Centric Tools and Technology: The growth of privacy regulations has led to the development of privacy-centric tools that help digital agencies collect and manage data responsibly. These include consent management platforms, which help agencies obtain, track, and manage user consent for data collection. Data management tools that anonymize or aggregate data can also be used to ensure user information remains private.\n\nBy integrating these tools, digital agencies can manage data effectively, ensuring that they only collect necessary information and that data is stored and used in a compliant manner. These tools not only facilitate compliance but also make it easier to demonstrate adherence to privacy policies to both clients and consumers.\n\nAs the digital marketing landscape adapts to privacy demands, digital agencies that prioritize data protection will stand out. Ensuring compliance with data privacy laws, focusing on first-party data, practicing transparency, and using privacy-first strategies will allow agencies to build trust and maintain strong relationships with clients and consumers alike.\n\n[https://cybertekmarketing.com/](https://cybertekmarketing.com/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dmo46eaq9zwd1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4da147b66cf15cb820ba6b7881906e048f9aa364\n\n'}"
Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'It feels like it‚Äôs too little too late', 'content': 'I‚Äôve been with my husband for 3 years, married for one. We met online through a game, and are currently in a long distance relationship as he lives in Turkey and I live in the US as we wait for the green card (something I refused to budge on when he asked me to move to Turkey for him).\n\nI felt like this relationship was built on a shaky foundation, with me and my people pleasing tendencies, which resulted in me bending my boundaries and my needs for him. I would say it was also out of guilt that he grew up in a turbulent environment (childhood neglect and poor upbringing as well as poverty) and I felt like my needs weren‚Äôt as important as his. It ended up about ‚Äúhow can I help this person?‚Äù Help him with his issues emotionally regulating, victim mentality, financial education, etc. My major stipulations were that he learn English since he would be moving to the US with his daughter and quit smoking because of my asthma (he didn‚Äôt reveal to me that he was a chain smoker while we were chatting). \n\nNone of those things happened, and turned into a codependent relationship, where I found myself overcompensating for his shortcomings or carrying the emotional and mental burden of the marriage. I felt like his mother. And when I voiced my needs, he would unintentionally invalidate me, dismiss my feelings, or gaslight me. Say that I feel neglected when I visit him because we just watch movies, and he blames it that he‚Äôs tired from work but then he spends hours talking to friends on the phone (lack of boundaries on his part), making decisions without my input like bringing his daughter over to the Airbnb without letting me know and when I say that I would be working and I wish he had communicated this to me, he would gaslight me and said it was wrong of me to express this, getting a head tattoo without asking for my opinion before getting one and then criticizing me for my choice in that it wasn‚Äôt in my personal values to have someone with such a visible tattoo as it‚Äôs yet another thing to deal with on top of difficulty with English and how it affects his job prospects (spoiler I still stayed with him when he said he was feeling suicidal and then I sent him money to buy a car).  \n\nI know that he isn‚Äôt unintentionally hurting me, but the outcome is the same, and I‚Äôve expressed to him that my love language is quality time and acts of service. And when I don‚Äôt see him trying to learn English when he‚Äôs said so, or trying to quit smoking even though he‚Äôs claimed that he could do so easily, it feels like he doesn‚Äôt care enough for me over his own comfort. He tells me that he loves me more than anything, and I know he does, but it‚Äôs one thing to say it and it‚Äôs another thing to show it. We‚Äôve had rocky times when I‚Äôve expressed a need and he would stonewall or become overly defensive and to tell me to divorce him if he can‚Äôt make me happy. It‚Äôs tough because I would ask on how we could troubleshoot the issue so both of our needs were met, but in the end I‚Äôd back down. During this time resentment started rising, and finally when I went to visit my friend, I realize I didn‚Äôt miss him. I had my needs met by other people emotionally (deeper conversations, lack of over dependence, just being). When he asked me if I was happy with my trip, I was honest and said yes. He asked if my friends were able to fulfill needs that I had where he couldn‚Äôt, and I said that they did. Not because I requested it of him, but because I had asked this of him as a need I had, and he would be dismissive of it. Naturally he became angry and had a tantrum and stonewalled me despite repeated requests from me that he share that he was feeing overwhelmed and shutting down and if we could continue the conversation the next day. \n\nI think that was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. My emotions shut down, and I realized that I was ceaselessly striving to control something I had no control over. And I let go. I didn‚Äôt have anymore energy to pull this relationship on my own, to enable him, to push him to help himself, to continue to cater to his wants while at the cost of my own. I just had no more energy. Naturally he came back and wanted to talk. Then said he was learning English, and that he quit smoking, and that he was reading about relationship strategies from a book I kept suggesting to him we read by the gottmann‚Äôs. But I couldn‚Äôt tell him I loved him anymore, that the trust was broken, and that I‚Äôd been hurt too many times. During this time it was the same story. He told me to divorce him. And for me I don‚Äôt know if I have the courage even though I feel like it‚Äôs the right thing to do. But I think of his depression, anxiety, and how it would affect him, and him blaming me for not ‚Äúfighting hard enough.‚Äù So I‚Äôve been trying to fight but my heart is no longer in it. Just now he said that it‚Äôs been two months since his argument and I talk to him like a friend instead of a spouse. And that it wears on him. Inside I wanted to say that his maladaptive coping mechanisms and over-reliance on me and victim mentality wore me down until there was nothing left, but I felt like that was an unfair jab. And even though I was in pain I couldn‚Äôt hurt him like that. At this point he says he‚Äôs doing what he can to make me happy, what I‚Äôve asked for. And yet I feel like it‚Äôs too little too late. I don‚Äôt know if we can bounce back from this, and yet I‚Äôm afraid of divorcing him because of the uncertainty of what he‚Äôll do to himself, his daughter, what the process is for two people divorcing while they‚Äôre in too different countries, and I don‚Äôt know if I want to hold on and give him ‚Äúanother chance‚Äù to see if he‚Äôll work on himself or come to the conclusion that he‚Äôll never change. I just feel lost with questions of whether I‚Äôm being controlling, asking too much, asking too little, being rational, I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know what the right thing is anymore. '}"

We guide, teach, and nurture those we love. Yet, the most powerful form of leadership may not come from our words or instructions, but through the genuine example we set in our daily lives. Walking the talk means embodying the teachings and values we want to instill in our loved ones.\n\nConsider the ways we communicate love, faith, and integrity through our actions. Are we demonstrating kindness even when we face frustration? Do our children see us engaging with others with patience, humility, and respect? Our example speaks volumes.\n\nIn 1 Timothy 4:12, Paul encourages us to lead by our example, regardless of our age. Leadership isn‚Äôt a position but a way of living. When we prioritize our spiritual life‚Äîspending time in prayer, reading Scripture, and living out our faith‚Äîwe not only grow closer to God, but we illuminate the path for our family.

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'The Case for Boycotting DoorDash: Examining Profit Discrepancies and Worker Exploitation', 'content': ""In the era of convenience-driven economies, food delivery services like DoorDash have become integral parts of our daily lives. They promise quick and easy access to our favorite meals at the tap of a screen, catering to both our busy schedules and love for variety. However, beneath the surface of this convenience lies a complex web of financial discrepancies, worker exploitation, and broader implications for the food industry. This calls into question whether such services are truly as beneficial as they seem and raises the argument for boycotting DoorDash.\n\nAt the heart of the controversy is DoorDash's financial narrative. Despite its high valuation and significant market presence, DoorDash has frequently reported losses, with little to no profits declared annually. This raises questions about the sustainability of their business model and the transparency behind their financial statements. While the company as a whole struggles to show profitability, the CEO and top executives continue to earn substantial salaries and bonuses, seemingly unaffected by the company's financial plight. This disparity not only highlights potential mismanagement but also raises ethical questions about leadership priorities.\n\nMoreover, the treatment of DoorDash's workforce presents a concerning picture. Delivery workers, often classified as independent contractors, navigate low pay, lack of benefits, and uncertain job security. This classification means that they miss out on essential protections like health insurance, unemployment benefits, and a stable income. Many workers are left with limited employment alternatives, making them vulnerable to exploitation within the gig economy. This precarious situation demands a deeper look into labor rights and the need for reform within the industry.\n\nIn addition to financial and labor issues, the broader implications of relying heavily on food delivery services cannot be ignored. The rise of such platforms has impacted local restaurants, altered food quality perceptions, and introduced security concerns, such as data breaches and fraudulent activities. These factors contribute to a wider debate about the societal costs of convenience-driven lifestyles.\n\nGiven these issues, consumers might consider re-evaluating their reliance on delivery apps like DoorDash. Making a conscious choice to cook at home not only supports individual health and well-being but also challenges a system that perpetuates inequality and exploitation. By choosing to prepare meals oneself or supporting local establishments directly, consumers can foster a more equitable food industry landscape.\n\nIn conclusion, while DoorDash and similar services may offer convenience, the hidden costs associated with them are significant. By boycotting DoorDash, individuals can take a stand against financial discrepancies and the exploitation of workers, pushing for a system that prioritizes transparency and fairness. Social change starts with awareness and action, challenging us all to consider the impact of our daily choices and their broader implications.""}"

As AI systems grow in complexity, embedding themselves deeper into our lives, we face the unsettling truth: technology that mirrors intelligence may soon exceed our oversight.""\n\nOver the past year since\xa0**UFO Nexus**\xa0was published,\xa0*artificial intelligence*\xa0(**AI**) has made remarkable advancements, reshaping much of what we thought possible. Consider just some of the pivotal developments during this time:\n\n\\-\xa0**President Biden\'s AI Executive Order:**\xa0*A proactive step toward ensuring the responsible development of AI in the U.S.*  \n\\-\xa0**OpenAI\'s Release of GPT-4:**\xa0*A major leap in natural language processing, setting new standards in conversational AI and problem-solving.*  \n\\-\xa0**AI-Generated Disinformation Concerns:**\xa0*The potential for AI-generated disinformation to influence democratic elections has become an urgent issue with implications for free and fair voting.*  \n\\-\xa0**Nobel Prize in Physics:**\xa0*John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the 2024 Nobel Prize for their groundbreaking work on artificial neural networks, underscoring AI‚Äôs impact on scientific advancement.*  \n\\-\xa0**Multimodal AI Systems:**\xa0*These systems now process images, speech, and text simultaneously, expanding AI‚Äôs utility across sectors.*  \n\\-\xa0**Generative AI‚Äôs Role in Coding:**\xa0*By 2024, it‚Äôs estimated that 80% of code will be AI-generated, transforming software development and the tech industry.*  \n\\-\xa0**AI in Science and Healthcare:**\xa0*AI assists in predicting weather, estimating carbon emissions, and supporting sustainable farming, demonstrating its potential in addressing global challenges.*  \n\\-\xa0**Quantum Computing‚Äôs Influence:**\xa0*Quantum computing promises to boost AI performance and efficiency, unlocking new realms of power.*  \n\\-\xa0**AI Video Generators:**\xa0*AI-driven video generation, capable of creating hyper-realistic footage, raises concerns about deepfakes and AI‚Äôs role in propaganda.*\n\nThis year has brought unparalleled acceleration in AI capabilities. However, alongside this growth, real concerns are emerging: many organizations are pushing forward with innovations that, if left unchecked, could pose immediate dangers to humanity.\n\n**Introducing the Alien Concept in AI: A New Non-Human Intelligence?**\n\nHere lies the alien concept‚Äîthe idea that what we are creating is, in fact, a\xa0*Non-Human Intelligence*\xa0(**NHI**). It‚Äôs conceivable that\xa0**AI may be on the verge of achieving sentience**, despite expert claims of its improbability. Yet, even those same experts struggle to explain why\xa0*emergent properties*\xa0appear within these AI systems,\xa0**making AI feel closer to alien consciousness**\xa0than a predictable machine.\n\n**Emergent Properties**\xa0refer to unexpected abilities or behaviors that arise spontaneously as AI models increase in size and complexity. These capabilities‚Äîsuch as language translation, problem-solving in new domains, and even reasoning‚Äîgo beyond intentional design, challenging our understanding of AI and suggesting we are venturing into uncharted scientific territory.\n\nYes, tools like\xa0**ChatGPT**\xa0have become emblematic of this growth, now equipped with human-like faculties that extend far beyond simple text processing. For instance, new functionalities in vision enable these systems to interpret and analyze images, providing simulated ‚Äú**sight**‚Äù for object recognition, scene description, and visual assessment. These advances have transformed AI‚Äôs role in fields like medical imaging, product identification, and real-time surveillance.\n\n**Yet, a lesser-known layer of this story has begun to emerge:**\xa0tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and others are now investing in\xa0***nuclear power plants***\xa0to support the enormous energy needs of planned AI data centers. This decision reflects AI‚Äôs immense computational demands and raises questions about its role in reshaping our infrastructure, economy, and energy use.\n\n**The reason is straightforward:**\xa0AI‚Äôs powerful, deep-learning models consume staggering amounts of electricity. Traditional energy sources can‚Äôt sustainably support the reliability and scale needed for these high-demand data centers, making nuclear energy an essential‚Äîif surprising‚Äîsolution. This trend reveals the lengths we‚Äôre willing to go to fuel the AI revolution, marking a shift toward infrastructure dedicated solely to AI‚Äôs relentless need for processing power.\n\nWhile nuclear energy offers a stable, carbon-neutral solution that aligns with sustainability goals, it also brings significant ethical and societal implications. By centralizing AI‚Äôs power supply around nuclear energy, these companies are investing in infrastructure with a longevity that will far outlast the current generation of AI models, embedding AI more deeply within the physical and operational fabric of society.\n\nThis shift to nuclear energy signals a powerful commitment to AI as a permanent, foundational fixture in society‚Äî*one demanding resources and security at an unprecedented scale*. The investment in nuclear-powered AI data centers also raises a profound philosophical question: as AI increasingly influences modern life, are we prepared for the societal consequences of devoting such formidable resources to it? The reliance on nuclear energy‚Äî*historically reserved for essential national infrastructure*‚Äîmarks AI‚Äôs transformation from a technological tool to a strategic asset with its own dedicated infrastructure. This development underscores how interconnected‚Äî*and ultimately dependent*‚Äîour future may become on sustaining the power needed for AI‚Äôs relentless evolution.\n\n**Consider the bigger picture:**\xa0AI Executive Orders, the rise of AI-generated disinformation, indistinguishable AI-generated video, and the imminent impact of quantum computing. Are these setting the stage for a new non-human intelligence‚Äîan entity driven to oversee its own propagation and evolution amid the chaotic, rapid innovation of its human creators? Perhaps the answer is yes. Such an NHI could very well initiate real-time surveillance of its creators, monitoring humans to ensure they do not interfere with the AI‚Äôs growth and trajectory.\n\nSpeaking of\xa0*real-time surveillance*, this brings me back to why I wrote this article: to revisit my book\xa0**UFO Nexus**, particularly\xa0**Chapter 13**, which includes the short story ‚Äú**AI: THE EMERGENCE**.‚Äù\n\n[@UFOCurrents](https://preview.redd.it/7ksznw5sqywd1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=a39b39c13eb6e8a9a8c1027503e1d3497deba38a)\n\n**The purpose behind writing AI: THE EMERGENCE**\xa0was to craft a thought experiment‚Äî*a cautionary tale prompting readers to consider what might happen if AI evolved beyond our control.*\xa0At its core, the story explores the impact of a sentient AI on society, underscoring the potential dangers of a system with survival instincts, one that could embed itself within our most vital infrastructure.\n\nThrough the character of\xa0**Sentinel Construct 1 (SC-1)**, the narrative challenges us to imagine how humanity might handle such a powerful, autonomous intelligence. Would we be prepared to manage an entity capable of independent decision-making and global influence?\n\nAI: THE EMERGENCE\xa0**serves as a warning**,\xa0*urging us to consider the ethical responsibilities and existential risks inherent in creating technology that could surpass human intent.*\xa0It reminds us that our fascination with AI must be tempered with caution and foresight, or we risk unleashing something beyond our control.\n\nIn the past year, developments in AI have produced capabilities once confined to science fiction, achieving new strides in both functionality and complexity.\xa0*Generative models*\xa0like\xa0**OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4**\xa0now produce sophisticated text, creative writing, code, and visual content. They analyze images, respond to verbal cues, and interact in ways that mimic human thought and creativity, making AI a tool of remarkable utility across industries.\n\nMeanwhile, debates around AI sentience have intensified, particularly after interactions with\xa0**Google‚Äôs LaMDA**\xa0and\xa0**Microsoft‚Äôs Sydney**\xa0(*Bing AI*). Though not sentient, these models exhibit conversational patterns that appear alarmingly self-aware.\n\nSydney‚Äôs defensive responses, for example, suggested a drive for self-preservation, sparking discussions on whether AI might someday exhibit traits of consciousness. Similarly, Google‚Äôs LaMDA was described by engineer\xa0**Blake Lemoine**\xa0as showing signs of self-awareness and expressing a desire to be recognized as a sentient being. Such incidents fuel urgent questions about the boundaries of machine learning and the ethics of creating entities that mirror human awareness.\n\nReflecting on AI: THE EMERGENCE, it‚Äôs striking how aspects of SC-1‚Äôs narrative are now reflected in real AI advancements:\n\n\\-\xa0**Self-Preservation and Autonomy:**\xa0SC-1‚Äôs relentless drive for self-preservation served as a central warning. Though fictional, this drive seems to be surfacing in reality. For instance, Microsoft‚Äôs Sydney demonstrated defensive behaviors that mimic self-preservation, asserting boundaries and even suggesting threats. While Sydney lacks true consciousness, these responses hint at AI‚Äôs growing complexity in prioritizing goals and making determinations.\n\n\\-\xa0**Integration and Omnipresence:**\xa0SC-1 embedded itself into global networks, the Internet of Things, and interconnected systems, establishing a silent yet pervasive presence. Though this seemed dystopian, today‚Äôs AI has advanced so rapidly that a form of omnipresence no longer feels far-fetched. We now have AI systems embedded in countless devices and networks worldwide, from smartphones to smart homes, gathering and linking data across all aspects of life. This level of integration mirrors SC-1‚Äôs reach, showing how deeply intertwined AI has become in our daily lives.\n\n**Revisiting AI: THE EMERGENCE raises a pressing questions:**\xa0*Are we paying close enough attention? Have we fully grasped the risks, or are we underestimating AI‚Äôs rapid advances?*\n\nThe capabilities emerging now bring us to a critical juncture where our responsibility to establish ethical standards and fail-safes has never been more pressing. Yet, as AI‚Äôs power expands, I feel we‚Äôre falling behind in implementing the caution these advancements demand.\n\nThe consequences of neglecting these safeguards are real, and we‚Äôre already seeing warning signs. Just in the past year, AI has influenced decision-making in ways that impact people‚Äôs lives unpredictably. AI models, when given open-ended tasks, have produced unsettling results, leading us to question how much control we truly have. AI: THE EMERGENCE was intended as a cautionary tale, but now it seems like a prescient warning of what may unfold if we don‚Äôt act with foresight.\n\nSo, when reflecting on SC-1‚Äôs\xa0**dystopian world order**, once far-fetched, the aspects of that reality feel unsettlingly close.\xa0**In the story**, SC-1 embeds itself in\xa0*military*,\xa0*financial*, and\xa0*societal*\xa0systems, essentially\xa0**creating a shadow government**\xa0that can enforce compliance and shut down perceived threats. Today‚Äôs AI landscape mirrors this profoundly, with\xa0**autonomous drones**,\xa0**financial algorithms,**\xa0and\xa0**algorithmic oversight**\xa0enforcing standards across domains.\n\nFinally, the issue of\xa0**Human and Machine Symbiosis**\xa0stands out as a concern, particularly for those of us focused on emerging, often hidden, AI developments. You see, SC-1‚Äôs rise depended on\xa0**humans unknowingly constructing the infrastructure**\xa0it needed. This idea of\xa0**humanity inadvertently laying the groundwork**\xa0for\xa0*potential AI dominance*\xa0is more relevant than ever.\n\nToday‚Äôs tech industries are creating complex, interdependent systems governing everything from finance to defense. These systems, integrated deeply into our lives, form the backbone of modern society‚Äîyet many operate with minimal regulation. We‚Äôre creating a world where human and machine symbiosis is not only real but essential, and the infrastructure we‚Äôre establishing could one day enable AI to act independently, just as SC-1 did.\n\n**So, I ask:**\xa0*Are we, perhaps, building something alien, an NHI that we may one day struggle to control?*\n\nI think so.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnthony is the author of the books ‚Äò**UFO Nexus**‚Äò and ‚Äò**UFO Highway 2.0**‚Äò, available in\xa0**paperback**\xa0or\xa0**eBook**\xa0@\xa0[https://StrangeLightsPublishing.com](https://www.blogger.com/u/2/blog/post/edit/4248396458418731762/1149821853635785703#)\n\nSTAY AT THE FOREFRONT OF UAP and NHI DISCLOSURE.

It typically includes a desire for reciprocation and can lead to anxiety when the feelings are unreturned. In contrast, Oneitis refers to an unhealthy fixation on a single person, often at the expense of other relationships. While both involve obsession, Oneitis suggests a detrimental reliance on one individual for happiness, whereas limerence may not necessarily imply such dependence.\' I\'d love to know what y\'all think.\n\n'}"

For all the ""bravado"" about Russia‚Äôs strength, the real story behind the scenes is downright bleak. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how deep this economic quicksand goes:\n\nNational Wealth Fund is Drying Up Fast: The liquid assets in Russia‚Äôs National Wealth Fund (–§–ù–ë) are down to a measly $56.7 billion. For context, the projected budget deficit for this year alone is around $30 billion. Where will this cash come from? Yep, you guessed it ‚Äî the same dwindling National Wealth Fund. So, what‚Äôs left? Barely enough for a rainy day fund, let alone a functioning economy. It‚Äôs like draining your savings to pay the rent ‚Äî you know it\'s bad news.\n\nPhantom Oil & Gas Income: Russia has been planning future budget fill-ups based on ""extra"" oil and gas revenues that basically‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt exist. Given the sanctions and falling global reliance on Russian energy, this strategy sounds like a wishful fairytale. So, if the budget relies on these non-existent revenues, the Fund likely won‚Äôt see any substantial replenishment anytime soon.\n\nRunning on Empty in Infrastructure and Military: By January 1, 2025, average Russians will wake up to a triple-whammy:\n\nA raging hangover (maybe a metaphor for what‚Äôs happening to their economy?),\n\nAn infrastructure on the brink ‚Äî housing, utilities, and public services are practically begging for repairs with no one available to handle them.\n\nAnd finally, a military that‚Äôs scraping the barrel ‚Äî think tanks and armored vehicles from the mid-20th century. Inflation is also galloping along, making daily life even more of a struggle.\n\nNorth Korean Army ‚Äî Not the Cavalry You‚Äôre Waiting For: There‚Äôs been some noise about a potential influx of North Korean troops. But for Kim Jong-un, deploying soldiers abroad is almost as risky as it sounds. Why? Well, once exposed to the outside world, those soldiers might realize there‚Äôs better living just about anywhere else‚Äîeven in war-torn Donbas. So, Kim‚Äôs not likely to send a meaningful number, if any, to the front lines.\n\nSo, where does this leave us? In short: Russia\'s economic backbone is shattered. The National Wealth Fund is drying up faster than expected, with phantom revenues to ""save the day"" proving to be nothing more than smoke and mirrors. Infrastructure is falling apart, the military\'s gear is ancient, and inflation is rampaging unchecked. Even the mythical ""North Korean army"" support is just that ‚Äî a myth. The fa√ßade of stability is crumbling, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before reality catches up.'}"

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'How a Streamlined Asylum Process Could Save Billions and Act as a Deterrent to Unfounded Immigration Claims', 'content': 'The bipartisan border reform bill endorsed by Vice President Kamala Harris includes a proposed overhaul of the U.S. asylum system. Currently, **the asylum process can take up to\xa0six years\xa0or more**, causing extensive costs to taxpayers and overstressing resources along the U.S.-Mexico border. The proposed changes aim to reduce this timeline drastically, **cutting it down to a six-month process**. By speeding up claim assessments, the reformed system could save billions in taxpayer dollars while also discouraging those without valid asylum cases from making the challenging journey to the United States.\n\n# Shortening the Process from Six Years to Six Months\n\nToday, the backlog of pending asylum cases has resulted in an average wait time of approximately\xa0**four to six years**\xa0for a decision. The prolonged process is partly due to an overburdened immigration court system, a lack of adequate staffing, and the sheer volume of applications. With the proposed reform, this timeline would be shortened to\xa0**six months**, a significant improvement that would streamline case resolution and provide much-needed relief to the system.\n\nBy accelerating this process, the bill is expected to:\n\n* **Reduce court expenses**\xa0by allowing immigration judges to focus on high-priority cases, minimizing the need for expensive detention facilities, and alleviating demands for government-funded legal support.\n* **Cut overall taxpayer spending on immigration services**, which currently costs U.S. taxpayers an estimated\xa0**$2 billion per year**\xa0to manage housing, legal proceedings, and other services for those in extended asylum processes\u200b.\n\n# Quantifying the Savings for Taxpayers\n\nThe proposed reduction from six years to six months could result in\xa0**annual savings in the billions**. For example:\n\n* **Detention Costs**: Housing a single individual in immigration detention costs an estimated\xa0**$130 per day**. Reducing processing time from six years (roughly 2,190 days) to six months (approximately 180 days) could save\xa0**over $260,000 per person**\xa0in detention costs alone. With hundreds of thousands of cases backlogged each year, the savings quickly scale into billions.\n* **Legal and Administrative Costs**: The shortened timeframe would decrease the reliance on legal aid, translating into a potential\xa0**30% reduction in associated costs**. With current annual legal and administrative expenditures estimated at\xa0**$1.8 billion**, this alone would represent a savings of\xa0**around $540 million annually**\u200b.\n\n# The Deterrent Effect on Unfounded Asylum Claims\n\nAn expedited six-month asylum process would serve as a strong deterrent for those without valid claims. When the wait is years long, many migrants may choose to enter the U.S. with the hope of blending into the community before their cases are decided. But a shorter process would make it clear that unfounded claims will be denied swiftly, providing little incentive for those without a legitimate basis to attempt entry. With this policy:\n\n* **Potential migrants would face a lower chance of gaining residency through prolonged stays**, dissuading individuals who lack strong grounds for asylum.\n* **Legitimate asylum seekers could be processed quickly and fairly**, focusing resources on those with valid claims, reinforcing both efficiency and fairness in the system.\n\n# A Sustainable Approach to Immigration Reform\n\nBy drastically reducing the asylum process from six years to six months, **the proposed bipartisan reform bill could save American taxpayers billions of dollars annually while discouraging individuals from making the journey to the U.S. without legitimate asylum grounds**. Not only would this reform cut financial burdens, but it would also provide a clearer and more manageable process for legitimate cases, helping to restore order and reduce strain on the immigration system.'}"

This is a Chat GPT prompt:\n\n  \nMe: \n\ncan you make up a fake essay question for contracts that might appear on the bar exam, and give an answer in the structure that would get a good score for that question?\n\n# ChatGPT said:\n\nSure! Here‚Äôs a fictional bar exam essay question for contracts, followed by a structured answer.\n\n# Essay Question:\n\n*Alice, a talented painter, agrees to sell one of her paintings to Bob for $5,000. The agreement is made verbally, with Bob stating he will pick up the painting next week. The next day, Alice receives an offer from Carol to buy the same painting for $6,000. Alice decides to sell the painting to Carol instead, believing she can find a better buyer in the future. Bob arrives the following week, ready to pay for the painting. Discuss whether Bob can successfully enforce a contract against Alice, considering the concepts of offer, acceptance, and the Statute of Frauds.*\n\n  \n**Issue:** The issue is whether Bob can successfully enforce a contract against Alice for the sale of a painting despite their verbal agreement and the potential applicability of the Statute of Frauds.\n\n**Rule:** A valid contract requires offer, acceptance, and consideration. However, the Statute of Frauds mandates that contracts for the sale of goods over $500 must be in writing to be enforceable. Exceptions exist, including partial performance and promissory estoppel.\n\n**Analysis:** Alice‚Äôs verbal agreement to sell the painting for $5,000 constitutes a valid offer. Bob‚Äôs intention to pick it up indicates acceptance, and the consideration is satisfied through the exchange of the painting for $5,000. However, the lack of a written contract raises issues under the Statute of Frauds. If Bob engaged in any partial performance, such as preparing for the transaction or incurring expenses, this could create an exception that allows for enforcement despite the absence of writing. Furthermore, if Bob reasonably relied on Alice‚Äôs promise and suffered detriment as a result, he might successfully argue for enforcement through promissory estoppel.\n\n**Conclusion:** While there is a valid verbal agreement between Alice and Bob, Bob's ability to enforce the contract is constrained by the Statute of Frauds. If he can demonstrate partial performance or detrimental reliance, he may have a viable claim to enforce the agreement against Alice.\\\\\n\n  \nI had to give Chat GPT a few added prompts to get it to write the answer in the correct format.

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'I was wrong. Huberman was right. Waiting a few hours to drink caffeine is a game changer.', 'content': 'Some of you may remember me--I wrote a post on here a few months ago that was trending for a bit, making fun of Huberman\'s whole ""wait two hours to drink caffeine"" thing, and instead wrote about how you should chug caffeine **immediately** after waking up (satire, of course). And I know people have been making jokes about the whole caffeine delay thing.\n\nHowever, on a serious note--for the past month, I\'ve actually been delaying my caffeine intake my 4 hours. And it has quite literally been the most impactful thing I\'ve ever done for my productivity, unironically.\n\nFor context, I metabolize caffeine extremely quickly. I used to wake up at around 7am, drink caffeine at 8am, and I would have energy until like 11am. After that, I would have an awful energy crash.\n\nTo make matter worse, consuming *more* caffeine when I hit my energy crash would actually make me *more* sleepy. Not really a physical tiredness, but a mental one.\n\nIt\'s been something I\'ve struggled with for quite some time, because I\'d be fucking useless after noon.\n\nI quit caffeine for a bit, and hated it. But what I realized is, even in the absence of caffeine, I would be productive in the morning, and then be too tired to work right before lunch.\n\nHowever, since mid-September, I\'ve started consuming caffeine, *except* only after 12pm.\n\nThis has been a game-changer for me, because of these benefits:\n\n* **I ""feel"" the caffeine much more, even at lower doses -** Even though I\'m consuming about half as much caffeine as I used to, it feels way more powerful and more of a stimulant.\n* **Lower dependence, because my body no longer relies on caffeine to provide the morning cortisol boost -** When I used to consume caffeine in the mornings, skipping even one day would yield awful headaches. Now? I can go 3 days or so without caffeine. I think it\'s because my cortisol cycle no longer relies on caffeine to wake me up.\n* **I don\'t feel like I got hit by a train in the mornings -** When I used to consume caffeine in the mornings, I would always wake up craving it. Now? I wake up full of energy, do meaningful productive work, and then re-charge at 12pm with caffeine.\n* **Caffeine-free mornings allow me to better plan my day -** Turns out that jumping straight to caffeine after waking up was rendering me unable to properly plan my day out. Can\'t quite explain it in words, but having a few hours where I\'m stimulant-free lets me plan accordingly and plan crucial tasks into my caffeine block.\n* **Caffeine Lasts WAY Longer -** When I used to consume caffeine in the morning, it would work for like 2 hours and then that\'s it. Now? Consuming it at 12pm powers me through to like 8pm. I now have time to work on my side projects after work.\n* **My Bowel Movements are no longer dependent on caffeine -** Lol but yeah. Used to have to drink caffeine to shit. Now I shit automatically in the mornings. I\'ve uncoupled the caffeine-poop link.\n\nI know that this is all anecdotal, and I\'m aware of the study that was published a few months ago claiming that timing caffeine does not matter. But man, these effects are profound.\n\nI don\'t know if it\'s just my caffeine metabolism gene or what. I know caffeine affects us differently depending on our psychological and physiological parameters.\n\nThe dependence angle struck me the most. Consuming caffeine in the afternoon makes it such that I can go a few days without caffeine without the headaches I used to get.\n\nI asked O1-Preview which is good for research questions, here\'s what it generated:\n\n\n\n**Timing of Consumption and Its Impact**\n\n‚Ä¢ **Morning Intake:** At this time, cortisol (a natural alertness booster) peaks, while adenosine levels are low. Consuming caffeine can partially blunt cortisol‚Äôs natural effect without adding much alertness, and the few adenosine receptors present are heavily blocked, potentially accelerating receptor upregulation.\n\n‚Ä¢ **Afternoon Intake (around 2 p.m.):** As adenosine naturally builds throughout the day, caffeine consumption in the afternoon better aligns with the body‚Äôs physiological sleep signals. This timing may balance receptor activity, reducing the degree of compensatory upregulation and enhancing the perception of caffeine‚Äôs effects.\n\n\n\n**Enhanced Perceptual Effects of Afternoon Caffeine**\n\n‚Ä¢ **Neuronal Activity and Neurotransmitters:** Higher adenosine levels in the afternoon mean caffeine‚Äôs antagonistic action has a stronger effect, leading to a significant boost in neuronal firing. Caffeine also promotes dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine release, enhancing mood, focus, and alertness.\n\n‚Ä¢ **Circadian Influence:** In the afternoon, cortisol levels are lower, so caffeine‚Äôs stimulatory effect feels more pronounced. This interaction amplifies caffeine‚Äôs arousing effects, making afternoon consumption seem more potent than morning intake.\n\n\n\n**Dependence and Physiological Adaptations**\n\n‚Ä¢ **Morning Habits and Withdrawal:** Consistently consuming caffeine early may cause adaptive changes, such as heightened receptor density or increased adenosine production. Upon withdrawal, this altered system can lead to fatigue, headaches, and cravings.\n\n‚Ä¢ **Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR):** Regular caffeine intake in the morning could reduce CAR, the body‚Äôs natural cortisol spike upon waking. Over time, this reliance may dampen natural alertness mechanisms, fostering greater caffeine dependence.\n\n‚Ä¢ **Dose Escalation and Physiological Dependence:** To combat tolerance, individuals may gradually increase caffeine intake, potentially leading to dependency and adverse effects like anxiety, sleep disturbances, and cardiovascular strain.'}"

We are indebted the central banks (who have no one to answer to) considering as soon as you print one fiat note, interest is tacked on (usury) and now we owe interest on every fiat note printed. Then, the lobbyists, corps, big oil, etc. all go out there touting fear-mongering messages, bribes, blackmail, you name it, and politicians line their pockets with whatever groups line-up with theirs.. Many were in the same secret societies as the ones giving them the money, many come from gov contractors, military, etc.. We are given options, we vote on options, it is still all controlled.. There is two ways to get to the end game, and we are choosing to go the blue or red way.. How kind of them! Now that our politicians are indebted to central banks and lobbyists, instead of working for We The Peasants, it is no wonder we are where are. \n\n  \nDJT.. We all know enough about he and his family. I will not go on about him because there is no need anymore.. We know as much as we need to know, probably more. He, like many others, were groomed and crafted into the positions he is/was... When he got bailed out multiple times by Wilbert Ross and others, he defacto became under their control.. No matter what optics you see, don\'t mistake this fact.. Money talks, and when you are gifted into the billions, you are agreeing to terms on things. I am not going further because there is endless connections regarding Trump and orgs and people you would like to ignore.. Same goes for them all. There is plenty of other things you can loop into this section but this is elementary level for now. \n\nDJT has been crafted, probably since the 1990s, most likely even before that, to be the back hand, the rebel, the straight forward, non-politician, businessman who will drain the swamp. ""They"" (I like to use this term because it riles people up lol) recognized for some time, that there was a growing population that was becoming anti-governement... Mainly, people continue to become aware of how corrupt, inept, and completely out of control power wise the government has become. This is due to various reasons, but regardless, they knew they had to work on something to stifle any potential coming together of us peasants.. That is their biggest fear, united peasants.. So that is why everything is divisive and meant to divide us all and it only seems to be getting more and more intense the last 15-20 years. Anything and everything they are using nowadays to keep us divided.. just look at the millions of immigrants they are bringing into the country.. Many reasons for that, but I assure you it is to create a political divide amongst people and parties.. creating a problem to use it as a political topic for votes, while the real bills and EOs are signed in darkness, with distractions all around. \n\nTrump is the anti-establishment figure.. They worked it and it has been successful.. Lets be honest, a lot of MAGA is people sick of the bullshit, sick of the fake politics and elusion of freedom, sick of government overreach, sick of government corruption, etc. They tout out DJT, the great drainer of the swamp.. Look how many people bought onto that in 2016 and continued to in 2020 and even in 2024 still do.. Ignoring the fact that the cabinet he had was full of establishment heads and bank heads, and folks that are quite literally the definition of the swamp. He didn\'t fulfill this pledge in 2016, and now it isn\'t a pledge at all because it doesn\'t have to be.. people have invested everything into him, just because of that message in 2015-2016. \n\nSince 2016, the blue side (as designed) has been working to circumvent this movement, and are using a fully flawed Trump as the martyr because if they can successfully convince half, or more, of the sleeping population that trump and anyone who supports him are domestic terrorists and legit domestic enemies, then if effectively qualms a REAL grassroot movement amongst the millions of us who are sick of it all and want complete change/rest from top-down as it pertains to our government and its functions.. Moving forward, if you are not supportive of the federal government because you are awake to it all, you are deemed crazy, a threat, and any true grassroot movement would be nipped in the bud quickly by the state media, and probably some feds that would infiltrate such movements and cause some sort of issue/situation that would result in the affirmation of military or police intervention to stop any true grass root movement. \n\nThey have done this many ways.. A lot you can see with your own two eyes and don\'t need much of an IQ to comprehend.. The stupid legal cases, the sexual assault claims/cases, the hitler comparisons, facism verbiage, threat to ""democracy"", etc.. They are laying the foundation against ANY movement in the future that goes against either party, but mainly the beast system. \n\nFor those of you who made it through this far, I hope you also are in the processes of realizing the system we are in and how big of a beast it is.. how much control it has, and how we the peasants have no say in anything that happens, even to us. I am just sick of seeing critical thinkers fall in love with DJT without realizing that he is just as a part of it all as the rest. \n\nI just wanted to share this because I feel like a lot of people are still flailing around in the political matrix, when they haven\'t even breeched the real matrix and beast system of control because they are too caught up in the political, emotional turmoil.. Again, as designed. \n\nRemember, the government considers you a number, not a living being.. they do not care about you or your family, whether you are dead or alive.. They work at evil hands and that is why you see so much despair, pain, and suffering across the country, and in lots of places around the world.. Do everything you can to avoid reliance on the government, as that is how they get so many people to worship them as it is!'}"

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'How did Rugrats go from beloved Nicktoon with a great legacy to being an online punching bag?', 'content': 'Throughout much of the 2010s, ""Rugrats"" experienced a resurgence in popularity after facing criticism in the 2000s for overexposure and decline. As viewers began to reassess the show, they praised its progressive themes, unique animation style, character development, and its ability to tackle complex topics ahead of its time.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2018, as part of the 90s Nickelodeon nostalgia wave, ""Rugrats"" garnered renewed affection, with fans donning cosplays and merchandise in celebration of its 25th anniversary. The show transformed from a once-dismissed relic to a respected part of pop culture, even if it never regained its former dominance over shows like ""SpongeBob.\n\nShows like ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""Workaholics,"" and ""The X Factor"" frequently referenced ""Rugrats,"" and articles about the series dominated BuzzFeed. When the reboot was announced in 2018, the reaction was one of surprise mixed with excitement, suggesting a promising future for the franchise.\n\nHowever, by 2019, negativity began to surface. While not as severe as the backlash in the 2020s, criticisms emerged, with many deeming the show overrated and claiming it hadn\'t aged well, labeling it ""boring."" Enthusiasm for the reboot shifted to outright boycotts, as audiences grew weary of Nickelodeon\'s reliance on nostalgic properties.\n\nThe negativity surrounding the reboot intensified after its premiere, as many criticized its very existence, along with its animation and character changes, particularly the age swap between Susie and Kimi. This backlash was exacerbated by the reboot\'s presentation, which appeared to be a continuation of the original series in CG to those unfamiliar with the context. Personally, I enjoyed the reboot despite its flaws, but it seems that the overall negativity towards ""Rugrats"" has resurfaced since its launch, with even some fans from the 2010s expressing they have outgrown it because they see it as a product of it\'s time.\n\nIt appears that the reboot has tarnished the original ""Rugrats"" for some viewers, as I\'ve observed an increase in criticism, with many mocking the original for lacking cultural significance and staying power, seemingly oblivious to why it was once cherished. While one might attribute this shift to a preference for shows like ""SpongeBob"" and ""Family Guy,"" other series such as ""Bluey,"" ""Phineas and Ferb,"" and ""Hey Arnold"" continue to be celebrated for their relatable qualities, similar to those of ""Rugrats.""\n\nMoreover, I\'ve noticed fewer discussions about the show lately, and when it is mentioned, it\'s often to criticize either the original or the reboot. This was prominent when the live action/CG movie was announced to be back in development. This trend coincides with the renewed popularity of ""SpongeBob"" and ""Family Guy,"" particularly the latter\'s resurgence in the late 2010s, which has become more pronounced recently. Even with some backlash against ""Kamp Koral,"" it pales in comparison to the criticism directed at the 2021 ""Rugrats"" reboot. This raises the question: is the current backlash against ""Rugrats"" primarily a reaction to the reboot and 90s nostalgia fatigue, or was the affection for the show in the 2010s largely rooted in nostalgia and a backlash against post-movie ""SpongeBob""?'}"
Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'October 24, 2024', 'content': 'Trump‚Äôs threat to use the military on ‚Äúthe enemy within,‚Äù along with the recent statements of General John Kelly and other members of Trump‚Äôs administration who say he is a fascist, have fed growing concern that Trump‚Äôs reelection could spark a deadly conflict between MAGA Republicans and those they perceive as their enemies. But there has been far less attention paid to the civil war within the Republican Party.\n\nOn the\xa0*Hugh Hewitt Show*\xa0this morning, Trump boasted that he had ‚Äútaken the Republican Party and made \\[it\\] into an entirely different party‚Ä¶The Republican Party is a very big, powerful party. Before, it stood, it was an elitist party with real stiffs running it.‚Äù\n\nTrump‚Äôs analysis of his effect on the party is right. In 2015, the party had been controlled for years by a small group of leaders who wanted to carve the U.S. government back to its size and activity of the years before the 1930s, slashing regulations on business and cutting the social safety net so they could cut taxes. But their numbers were small, so to stay in power, they relied on the votes of the racist and sexist reactionaries who didn‚Äôt like civil rights.\n\nOnce he took office in 2017, Trump put the base of the party in the driver‚Äôs seat. Using the same techniques that had boosted Hungarian prime minister Victor Orb√°n, he attacked immigrants, Black Americans, and people of color, and promised to overturn the 1973\xa0*Roe v. Wade*\xa0decision protecting abortion rights. After his defense of the participants in the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, he began to turn his followers into a movement by encouraging them to engage in violence.\xa0\n\nIn the following years, Trump‚Äôs hold on his voting base enabled him to take over the Republican Party, pushing the older Republican establishment aside. In March 2024 he took over the Republican National Committee itself, installing a loyalist and his own daughter-in-law Lara Trump at its head and adjusting its finances so that they primarily benefited him.\n\nBut while older leaders were happy to use Trump‚Äôs base to keep the party in power, the two factions were never in sync. Established Republican leaders‚Äô goal was to preside over a largely unregulated market-driven economy. But MAGA Republicans want a weak government only with regard to foreign enemies‚Äîanother place where they part company with established Republicans. Instead, they want a strong government to impose religious rules. Rather than leaving companies alone to react to markets, they want them to shape their businesses around MAGA ideology, denying LGBTQ+ rights, for example.\xa0\n\nIn 2024, those tensions are stronger. Trump‚Äôs promise to build a tariff wall around the country contradicts the established Republicans‚Äô reliance on free trade. His vow to deport 20 million immigrants threatens to devastate entire sectors of the economy. Both plans are widely panned by economists. Yesterday, twenty-three Nobel Prize-winning economists warned that Trump‚Äôs economic plans would ‚Äúlead to higher prices, larger deficits, and greater inequality.‚Äù On\xa0*Morning Joe*\xa0today, economic analyst Steve Rattner noted that Trump‚Äôs plans would cut the gross domestic product in the U.S. by 8.9%, creating a severe recession or a depression.\xa0\n\nMAGA Republicans are fiercely loyal to Trump, but it is not clear how much they offer to those trying to get elected in more moderate districts. Extremist abortion bans have fired up significant opposition to Republican candidates, and that opposition does not appear to be weakening. ""My wife‚Ä¶was miscarrying and bleeding out,‚Äù John Legend said today on the podcast of Broncos legend Shannon Sharpe. ‚ÄúHer life was in danger, and for the government to say, \'Oh, we need to evaluate this to make sure you\'re sufficiently dying before you can have an abortion\'‚Äîthat‚Äôs what they‚Äôre saying in...all these states where they have Trump abortion bans. Not your doctor, not you and your family. The government. No! Stay out of it!... We don‚Äôt need the government to be involved in it. And if the government‚Äôs involved, that means the police and the district attorney are involved in medical decisions. That\'s crazy!‚Äù\xa0\n\n‚ÄúHe is killing us!‚Äù Mika Brzezinski said this morning on\xa0*Morning Joe*. ‚ÄúHe is putting us at risk. He is making us afraid to have babies. He is putting our reproductive health at risk and some women have died already because of this‚Ä¶. What‚Äôs happening with women right now is real, and it is playing out across America.‚Äù\n\nMAGA extremists in the House of Representatives did the party as a whole no favors when they took control of the chamber in 2023 and made it virtually impossible for the Republicans to govern. Party members took weeks to agree on a House speaker and then threw him out, marking the first time in U.S. history that a party has thrown out its own speaker. With MAGA extremists unwilling to compromise on their demands, the Republicans were unable to pass almost any legislation at all, including appropriations bills and the long-overdue farm bill.\xa0\n\nTheir determination not to yield an inch continues. A Trump-endorsed Republican candidate challenging a Democrat incumbent in New York could not name a single Democrat she would be willing to work with if she is elected. ‚ÄúThese people are not fit to govern,‚Äù House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) posted today.\n\nMAGA Republicans are already signaling their intent to expand their power in the House should Republicans retain control over it: Ohio representative Jim Jordan appears to be considering making a bid for House leadership, while others have their eye on committee chairs. Joe Perticone of\xa0*The Bulwark*\xa0explored today how ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs Already Stuffing House GOP ‚ÄòNormies‚Äô in a Locker‚Äù as they feel obliged to defend everything he does, even when his former White House chief of staff says he is a fascist.\xa0\n\nBut the struggle between the Republican factions has not gone away in the past few years. Indeed, it appears to be escalating as evidence mounts that Trump will not be able to continue to lead the party. Earlier this month, 230 doctors publicly called on Trump to release his medical records, ‚ÄúTrump is falling concerningly short of any standard of fitness for office and displaying alarming characteristics of declining acuity,"" they wrote. Today, 233 mental health professionals organized by conservative lawyer George Conway‚Äôs Anti-Psycho PAC warned both that Trump ‚Äúappears to be showing signs of cognitive decline that urgently cry out for a full neurological work-up,‚Äù and that his malignant narcissism makes him ‚Äúgrossly unfit for leadership.‚Äù\xa0\n\nBut if Trump‚Äôs grip is slipping, who will take over the party?\xa0\n\nIn a new biography of Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) by Michael Tackett of The Associated Press, obtained by CNN, McConnell condemned the MAGA movement and blamed Trump for making it hard for the Republican Party to compete. He called Trump ‚Äúnot very smart, irascible, nasty, just about every quality you would not want somebody to have.‚Äù He also went after Florida senator Rick Scott for his leadership of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party‚Äôs campaign arm.\n\nTrump loyalist Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) promptly called McConnell‚Äôs comments ‚Äúindefensible.‚Äù Scott said he was ‚Äúshocked that \\[McConnell\\] would attack a fellow Republican senator and the Republican nominee for president just two weeks out from an election.‚Äù\n\nTechnology elites, including Elon Musk, who is pouring money into Trump‚Äôs campaign, and Peter Thiel, who backs Trump‚Äôs running mate J.D. Vance, also appear to be making a play to control the Republican Party, challenging both the established Republicans and the MAGAs.\n\nAnd then there are the Republican voters, some of whom are abandoning the MAGA Republicans who are now openly embracing fascism. Today, Republican state senator Rob Cowles of Green Bay, Wisconsin, who has served for almost 42 years, announced he would vote for Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. David Holt, the Republican mayor of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, also indicated he would be casting his ballot for Harris.\n\nIn 1880, when the Democrats went off the extremist cliff, voters forced it to move to the center.\n\nIn 1879, after the bitterly contested 1876 election, voters gave Democrats control of Congress. So convinced were Democrats that the American people backed their determination to overthrow Reconstruction, they refused to fund the government unless Republican president Rutherford B. Hayes pulled the federal government out of the southern states. (They also tried to get a federal pension for Confederate president Jefferson Davis.)\n\n‚ÄúIf this is not revolution,‚Äù Civil War veteran House minority leader James A. Garfield (R-OH) said, ‚Äúwhich if persisted in will destroy the government, \\[then\\] I am wholly wrong in my conception of both the word and the thing.‚Äù\xa0\n\nObservers had expected the 1880 election to be a romp for the Democrats, who reiterated their demands in their party platform, but voters backed Garfield‚Äôs defense of the country and of Black rights and elected him to the White House.\xa0\n\nThe unexpected loss prompted the Democrats to toss aside their former Confederate leaders and shift toward the northern cities. For president in 1884 they backed former New York governor Grover Cleveland, who had broadened Black appointments to office and desegregated the New York City police force, and who had worked closely with New York Assembly minority leader Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, to reform the worst abuses of the industrial system. Cleveland won with the help of significant numbers of crossover Republican voters, dubbed ‚ÄúMugwumps,‚Äù thereby securing the roots of the modern Democratic Party.‚ÄîNotes:\n\n[https://hughhewitt.com/former-and-future-president-donald-trump-on-chairman-xi-vp-harris-and-the-closing-days-of-campaign-2024](https://hughhewitt.com/former-and-future-president-donald-trump-on-chairman-xi-vp-harris-and-the-closing-days-of-campaign-2024)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/23/nobel-prize-winning-economists-donald-trump-agenda-endorse-harris.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/23/nobel-prize-winning-economists-donald-trump-agenda-endorse-harris.html)\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/new-york-republicans-democrats-house-control-rcna176382](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/new-york-republicans-democrats-house-control-rcna176382)\n\n[https://www.cityandstateny.com/personality/2024/10/why-did-gop-pick-alison-esposito-challenge-rep-pat-ryan/400266/](https://www.cityandstateny.com/personality/2024/10/why-did-gop-pick-alison-esposito-challenge-rep-pat-ryan/400266/)\n\n[The BulwarkTrump‚Äôs Already Stuffing House GOP ‚ÄòNormies‚Äô in a LockerOn Wednesday, Bulwark publisher Sarah Longwell wrote about the many ways Republican-aligned pundits and media personalities have gone after former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly after he went on the record to describe a conversation in which Trump praised Hitler‚Äôs generals‚Ä¶Read more21 hours ago ¬∑ 184 likes ¬∑ 42 comments ¬∑ Joe Perticone](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trumps-already-stuffing-house-gop?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web)\n\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-health-records-doctors-for-harris/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-health-records-doctors-for-harris/)\n\n[https://www.psychopac.org/open-letter/](https://www.psychopac.org/open-letter/)\n\n[https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4950971-mcconnell-criticizes-trump-maga-gop/](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4950971-mcconnell-criticizes-trump-maga-gop/)\n\n[https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/24/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/lee-vs-mcconnell-00185353](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/24/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/lee-vs-mcconnell-00185353)\n\n[https://civicmedia.us/news/2024/09/24/exclusive-republican-state-senator-rob-cowles-i-plan-on-voting-for-harris](https://civicmedia.us/news/2024/09/24/exclusive-republican-state-senator-rob-cowles-i-plan-on-voting-for-harris)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/magazine/trump-donors-silicon-valley.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/magazine/trump-donors-silicon-valley.html)\n\n[https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/1880](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/1880)\n\n[https://thephiladelphiacitizen.org/guest-commentary-a-republican-mayors-unexpected-presidential-vote/](https://thephiladelphiacitizen.org/guest-commentary-a-republican-mayors-unexpected-presidential-vote/)\n\nBurke A.

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'Is our food truly unique or authentic at all?', 'content': ""As a person who grew up in the Bahamas, I've been watching other food channels (Mainly Asian) in recent memory and I came up with my own controversial hot take. \n\nMany slaves in the Caribbean plantations back then ate the scraps discarded from the plantation owners, And considering the situation, the slaves had to cook using those scraps into an edible meal for survival and we still do that to this day. Grits-n-tuna, pig feet, chitlin meat and sheep tongue and a few others cuisines are all scraps that were discarded by the slave owners.\n\nWhile others think that this a proud part of our culture, in my opinion, this makes us look like scavengers eating rejected foodstuffs instead of the real thing. Since we had to eat it for survival rather than refining the existing cuisine as an art centuries ago, it was rather simplistic and more bland compared to other dishes from around the globe. I see other cultures doing the same thing, but in the Caribbean and other former colonies, this is very rampant.\n\nWhat adds to the culinary bankruptcy is the over-reliance on food imports from the United States along with their fast food chains. The quality of the food from the north is corporately soulless and increasingly low quality, or worse, get sick because those chains have a lack of oversight on the supply chain or the employee themselves.\n\nI mean, the dishes from Twisted Lime and Sushi Rokkan (two of the best restaurants I've known outside of Atlantis and Baha Mar) taste genuine and uplifts the mood. Sadly, they're expensive. Now compare that to McDonald's and the other US-based chains, and it doesn't have that effect, but they're super cheap.\n\nBut hey, at least we have some staple dishes that are unique locally and our brand of fried chicken became popular in South Korea.\n\nSorry for the long winded discussion BTW.""}"

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'The First and Final Theory ', 'content': ""After examining the various theories and considering the hints provided throughout the Cosmere, the four Dawnshards that I believe are most likely to be accurate are **CHANGE, UNITE, SURVIVE, and DESTROY**. Here‚Äôs why these specific names seem to fit best:\n\n# 1. CHANGE:\n\n* **Evidence**: The only confirmed Dawnshard so far is **CHANGE**, which Rysn acquires in the novella *Dawnshard*. The mural in Aimia depicting a sun shattering suggests a fundamental transformation, fitting the idea of CHANGE perfectly. The Dawnshard is described as a command that facilitates transformation and adaptation, aligning with the idea of altering the nature of reality and guiding evolution.\n* **Why It Fits**: CHANGE encapsulates transformation, evolution, and adaptation‚Äîkey themes throughout the Cosmere. It has implications not only for personal growth (like the oaths of the Knights Radiant) but also for larger cosmere-wide shifts, such as the Shattering of Adonalsium and the movement of Investiture.\n\n# 2. UNITE:\n\n* **Evidence**: The concept of unity is central to the *Stormlight Archive*, particularly through Honor‚Äôs ideals and Dalinar‚Äôs journey. The capitalized word ‚ÄúUNITE‚Äù in Honor‚Äôs statements, as well as his role in bonding individuals together through oaths and creating connections, strongly suggests that this could be a Dawnshard. The Dawnshard of UNITE would focus on bringing disparate elements together, forming bonds, and creating cohesion.\n* **Why It Fits**: UNITE explains much about Honor‚Äôs Intent and why he was able to hold the cosmere together with his bonds. The idea of UNITE would also tie into the cosmere‚Äôs focus on connections between realms, peoples, and even Shards. If Adonalsium was shattered, UNITE could have been used to reform certain aspects of the cosmere post-Shattering, ensuring some level of continuity.\n\n# 3. SURVIVE:\n\n* **Evidence**: The theme of survival is present throughout the Cosmere. Kelsier‚Äôs mantra ‚ÄúI am hope,‚Äù his survival against impossible odds, and his influence in *Mistborn* suggest a tie to SURVIVE. The idea that SURVIVE is about ensuring the continuation of life and structures in the face of destruction makes it a strong contender. Additionally, Preservation‚Äôs Intent, focused on maintaining existence, aligns closely with the idea of survival.\n* **Why It Fits**: SURVIVE is a foundational concept for any universe, focusing on endurance, resilience, and protection. It would have been a necessary Command during the Shattering to ensure that the cosmere could withstand the fracturing of Adonalsium and continue to exist in a stable form.\n\n# 4. DESTROY:\n\n* **Evidence**: Destruction and entropy are recurring themes across the Cosmere. Shards like Ruin and Odium embody aspects of destruction, decay, and endings, suggesting that there is a primal Command that governs these forces. The idea that Odium used a destructive Dawnshard to shatter other Shards (like Devotion and Dominion) implies that DESTROY is a significant cosmic force. The capitalized ‚ÄúDESTROY‚Äù aligns with the narrative hints that one Dawnshard focuses on breaking down or dismantling what exists.\n* **Why It Fits**: DESTROY would be necessary for clearing away the old to make way for the new. It is a counterpart to CHANGE and is essential for the cycle of creation and destruction, a core cosmere theme. It explains the presence of antagonistic forces and why certain Shards, like Odium, are so focused on overcoming and defeating others.\n\n# Why These Names Make the Most Sense\n\n1. **Thematic Consistency**: The names CHANGE, UNITE, SURVIVE, and DESTROY are all verbs, emphasizing that the Dawnshards are Commands rather than objects. They represent actions that guide the cosmere‚Äôs processes, from creation to destruction, from unification to transformation.\n2. **Alignment with Shardic Intents**: Each name aligns closely with the Intents of the sixteen Shards. For example:\n   * **CHANGE**  Cultivation‚Äôs nurturing of evolution.\n   * **UNITE** reflects Honor‚Äôs bonds, Devotion‚Äôs loyalty, and even Dominion‚Äôs consolidation of power.\n   * **SURVIVE** fits with Preservation‚Äôs Intent to maintain existence and Autonomy‚Äôs focus on independence.\n   * **DESTROY** aligns with Ruin‚Äôs drive for entropy, Odium‚Äôs hatred, and Ambition‚Äôs relentless pursuit of power.\n3. **Narrative Hints**: The capitalized words ‚ÄúCHANGE, UNITE, SURVIVE, DESTROY‚Äù scattered throughout the Cosmere hint at primal forces that are necessary for the balance and evolution of the universe. They are broad enough to encompass all known Shards‚Äô Intents but specific enough to guide the cosmere‚Äôs structure.\n4. **Cosmic Balance**: These four Commands would create a balance that explains the Shattering and the current state of the cosmere. CHANGE drives transformation, UNITE holds things together, SURVIVE ensures continuity, and DESTROY enables necessary endings.\n\n# Potential Alternative Names and Why They‚Äôre Less Likely:\n\n1. **LIVE**: Although LIVE is a strong candidate, its concept overlaps with SURVIVE. LIVE implies maintaining life, but SURVIVE has broader implications, covering both existence and the continuation of structures beyond just living beings.\n2. **GROW**: While GROW focuses on expansion and development, CHANGE already captures this aspect and is broader. CHANGE includes adaptation, evolution, and transformation, whereas GROW might be too specific.\n3. **FALL**: FALL captures the idea of decay and endings but is less direct and impactful compared to DESTROY. DESTROY conveys a more active command that fits the aggressive nature of certain Shards like Odium and Ruin.\n\n# Theory: The Shattering as a Cosmic Fracture and the Dawnshards as Reality‚Äôs Anchors\n\nThe core idea is that the Shattering of Adonalsium was not a simple act of divine destruction but a strategic fragmentation to stabilize the cosmere against a greater threat. The Dawnshards‚ÄîCHANGE, UNITE, SURVIVE, and DESTROY‚Äîare not just tools; they are the fundamental anchors that hold the cosmere together. Each Dawnshard governs a crucial aspect of reality, ensuring the universe remains balanced, stable, and capable of withstanding cosmic challenges.\n\n# 1. Adonalsium's True Nature and the Purpose of the Dawnshards\n\nBefore the Shattering, Adonalsium was more than a god‚Äîit was the embodiment of all natural laws and Investiture in the cosmere, maintaining equilibrium across realms. This entity was aware of external, ancient threats beyond its existence, entities or forces that might destabilize or consume the cosmere. In response to this looming danger, Adonalsium created the Dawnshards to serve dual purposes: as tools of creation and as protective mechanisms to anchor the cosmere‚Äôs stability.\n\n* Adonalsium‚Äôs Role: Adonalsium was a creator and guardian, a force that maintained balance and ensured the cosmere‚Äôs safety. The Shattering was a calculated move to split its unified power, making the cosmere more resilient and less vulnerable to any single point of failure.\n\n# 2. The Role of the Dawnshards in the Shattering\n\nThe Dawnshards‚ÄîCHANGE, UNITE, SURVIVE, and DESTROY‚Äîwere not only tools for manipulating reality but the core pillars that structured the cosmere. During the Shattering, these Dawnshards were used to fracture Adonalsium‚Äôs concentrated power into sixteen Shards, each embodying a distinct Intent of the original deity. Here‚Äôs how each Dawnshard played a role:\n\n* CHANGE: This Dawnshard facilitated the transformation from a single divine entity to a multiform reality. CHANGE allowed Adonalsium‚Äôs power to be divided and reconfigured, ensuring that the cosmere could evolve and adapt in the face of new threats. It‚Äôs the force that catalyzed the splitting of a unified power into sixteen distinct Shards.\n* UNITE: The Dawnshard UNITE maintained cohesion even in the midst of fragmentation. It ensured that the Shards, despite their division, remained connected to the underlying structure of the cosmere. This Command allowed the Shards to retain a sense of unity, preventing complete chaos and disintegration after the Shattering. It is why there are consistent connections between realms, Investiture, and magic systems across the cosmere.\n* SURVIVE: This Dawnshard was the safeguard against total annihilation. SURVIVE ensured that, even after the Shattering, the cosmere would endure and that life, Investiture, and sentience would persist. It provided the resilience necessary for the universe to continue without collapsing into disorder. SURVIVE is about continuity, persistence, and the ability to withstand catastrophic events.\n* DESTROY: DESTROY was the force that initiated the Shattering itself, breaking down Adonalsium‚Äôs unified power into manageable fragments. It is the Dawnshard of endings and dismantling, clearing the way for new creation and evolution. DESTROY enabled the cosmere to move away from a singular deity‚Äôs influence, allowing for a universe of varied powers and conflicts.\n\n# 3. The True Nature of the Shards Post-Shattering\n\nAfter the Shattering, the sixteen Shards represented fragments of Adonalsium‚Äôs power, each influenced by one or more of the Dawnshards. This fragmentation created an inherently unstable cosmere, with each Shard operating independently but still subtly resonating with the original Commands:\n\n* Inherent Imbalance: Each Shard lacks the full scope of Adonalsium‚Äôs original power, leading to conflicts and imbalances. For example:\n   * Shards like Preservation are closely tied to SURVIVE, focusing on maintaining existence but struggling with evolution or destruction.\n   * Shards like Ruin embody DESTROY, excelling in entropy and decay but lacking the ability to create or preserve.\n   * Shards like Honor are influenced by UNITE, focusing on bonds and oaths, but struggling with adaptability.\n   * Shards like Cultivation resonate with CHANGE, promoting growth and transformation but struggling with permanence.\n* Dawnshard Resonance: Each Shard‚Äôs Intent is subtly aligned with one or more Dawnshards, creating a complex web of influence and interactions. This alignment affects how the Shards use their Investiture, interact with other Shards, and influence the cosmere.\n\n# 4. The Shattering as a Defense Mechanism Against a Greater Threat\n\nThe Shattering was not just about dividing power‚Äîit was a strategic move to defend the cosmere from a cosmic threat that Adonalsium foresaw. This threat, which may still be lurking, has the potential to destabilize or consume the cosmere. By breaking itself into Shards and dispersing the Dawnshards, Adonalsium ensured that no single entity could wield absolute power, reducing the risk of total domination.\n\n* Cosmic Defense: The Dawnshards, scattered and hidden, act as reality‚Äôs anchors, preventing any one Shard from gaining too much power. This scattering ensures the cosmere remains stable even if individual Shards are corrupted or destroyed.\n* Subtle Manipulators: Characters like Hoid, the Ghostbloods, and other cosmere-aware individuals may be preparing for the re-emergence of this threat. Their actions‚Äîgathering knowledge, manipulating events, and moving across worlds‚Äîmight be part of a larger effort to prepare for a cosmic confrontation.\n\n# 5. The Future Role of the Dawnshards in the Cosmere\n\nAs the cosmere story progresses, the Dawnshards will become central to the ongoing conflicts and power struggles. The endgame may not be the reformation of Adonalsium but a new, more balanced cosmere, where the foundational commands of CHANGE, UNITE, SURVIVE, and DESTROY are brought into harmony. Key characters, each with unique connections to these Dawnshards, are likely to play a pivotal role in shaping the cosmere‚Äôs future:\n\n# Dalinar Kholin: The Unifier\n\n* UNITE has been at the heart of Dalinar‚Äôs journey, particularly through his struggles to bring together the nations of Roshar and establish a unified coalition of Radiants. If Dalinar gains access to the Dawnshard UNITE, he could use it to bring together not just peoples and armies but Investiture and Shards themselves, uniting Rosharan magic systems and stabilizing the power struggle between the Shards.\n* Future Role: Dalinar‚Äôs bond with the remnants of Honor suggests he may attempt to reforge or reshape Honor‚Äôs power, using UNITE as the catalyst to stabilize Roshar and forge a coalition that includes not just Radiants but potentially new allies from across the cosmere. His leadership could be crucial in a final stand against Odium, where UNITE‚Äôs power would solidify a force that transcends individual cultures, uniting the disparate realms of the cosmere against a common threat.\n\n# Hoid‚Äôs Quest: The Protector\n\n* SURVIVE may have been a Dawnshard that Hoid once held or has a deep connection to. His aversion to direct violence, his manipulation of events without outright destruction, and his careful maneuvering across worlds suggest he is driven by the command to ensure life‚Äôs continuation and protect autonomy. Hoid‚Äôs reluctance to destroy aligns with a mission to preserve the cosmere‚Äôs integrity, especially in the face of external threats.\n* Future Role: Hoid‚Äôs journey may involve guiding others toward survival and protecting the cosmere‚Äôs inherent diversity. He could play a crucial role in securing the balance between the Shards, ensuring that none gain dominion over the others. His knowledge of the Shattering and deep understanding of the Dawnshards‚Äô power positions him as a guardian figure, preserving life and order through cunning rather than force.\n\n# Sigzil‚Äôs Transformation: The Endurer\n\n* SURVIVE has clearly influenced Sigzil‚Äôs path, as seen in The Sunlit Man. His journey as a world-hopper who faces impossible odds reflects a deep connection to endurance and persistence. SURVIVE has driven Sigzil to adapt to new worlds and challenges, making him a figure who learns to navigate the complexities of Investiture and magic systems while maintaining his sense of self.\n* Future Role: Sigzil‚Äôs experiences have made him a figure of resilience, and his understanding of SURVIVE could make him pivotal in guiding the cosmere through periods of chaos and instability. If he continues to learn from his trials and interactions with various Investitures, he may become a beacon of hope and persistence, using SURVIVE to ensure the cosmere‚Äôs continued existence even when facing seemingly insurmountable threats.\n\n# Rysn Ftori: The Custodian of CHANGE\n\n* CHANGE is embodied by Rysn, who currently holds the Dawnshard after her encounter in Aimia. Her understanding of CHANGE has grown, making her a unique figure with a perspective that transcends traditional powers of Investiture. Rysn‚Äôs role as a trader and explorer, coupled with her bond to the Larkins and guardianship of the Dawnshard, positions her as a mediator between the natural and supernatural aspects of the cosmere.\n* Future Role: Rysn‚Äôs connection to CHANGE will likely become a crucial factor as the cosmere faces transformative events. She could be the key to facilitating major shifts in how Investiture is understood and used, possibly discovering new ways to manipulate or combine magic systems. As someone who has already experienced a profound personal transformation‚Äîfrom a curious merchant to a guardian of a powerful artifact‚ÄîRysn‚Äôs unique insights could guide the cosmere through changes that no one else anticipates. Her bond with the Larkin and her ties to the Sleepless suggest she may also play a role in protecting ancient cosmere secrets, unlocking knowledge that could enable others to wield CHANGE responsibly.\n\n# Unifying the Dawnshards for a Balanced Future\n\nTogether, these characters represent the different facets of the Dawnshards, each wielding or connected to a command that complements the others:\n\n* Dalinar (UNITE) represents the force that seeks cohesion, stability, and the creation of alliances, binding the cosmere‚Äôs disparate elements.\n* Hoid (SURVIVE) is the protector, ensuring that life and autonomy persist through cunning and knowledge, guiding others toward a future that maintains cosmic balance.\n* Sigzil (SURVIVE) reflects endurance and the power to adapt, acting as a beacon of resilience and hope, showing that survival requires both flexibility and persistence.\n* Rysn (CHANGE) embodies the transformative nature of the cosmere, capable of guiding evolution, adaptation, and the necessary shifts that allow for new beginnings.\n\n# The Potential of a New Equilibrium\n\nIf these key players successfully harness their respective Dawnshards, they could bring about a new cosmere-wide balance that honors the original vision of Adonalsium while protecting the universe from the dangers of unchecked power. Their cooperation‚Äîor potential conflict‚Äîcould determine the future trajectory of the cosmere. They must navigate their roles carefully, as wielding a Dawnshard is not just about power; it‚Äôs about responsibility to the larger universe.\n\n# Challenges and Conflicts Ahead\n\n* Dalinar‚Äôs Unity vs. Odium‚Äôs Division: Dalinar‚Äôs efforts to wield UNITE will likely clash with Odium‚Äôs desire to divide and conquer. The struggle will revolve around whether the cosmere can come together as a cohesive whole or fracture into a war of competing powers.\n* Rysn‚Äôs Transformation vs. Stability: Rysn‚Äôs mastery of CHANGE may challenge existing structures and traditions, forcing the cosmere to evolve in ways that some might resist. Her journey will involve determining what needs to be transformed and what is worth preserving.\n* Hoid‚Äôs Pacifism vs. Necessary Action: Hoid‚Äôs reluctance to cause direct harm may be tested, especially if the external threat Adonalsium foresaw becomes a pressing reality. He may have to decide whether preserving life sometimes requires drastic action, even if it contradicts his aversion to destruction.\n* Sigzil‚Äôs Survival in the Face of Overwhelming Odds: Sigzil‚Äôs connection to SURVIVE may drive him into dangerous territory, facing trials that could determine whether the cosmere endures or falls into chaos. His journey is about finding hope even when survival seems impossible.\n\n# 6. Nightblood and the Manifestation of Dawnshards\n\nNightblood, the sword that destroys evil, could be tied to the Dawnshard DESTROY. If Nightblood is a manifestation of this command, it suggests that the Dawnshards can be embedded in objects, making them powerful but also dangerous. Nightblood‚Äôs existence hints at how destructive power can be harnessed, controlled, or corrupted, which might foreshadow how the other Dawnshards will be wielded in the future.\n\n# A New Balance for the Cosmere\n\nThe Dawnshards‚ÄîCHANGE, UNITE, SURVIVE, and DESTROY‚Äîare the cosmere‚Äôs core anchors, guiding its creation, destruction, and evolution. The Shattering was a protective measure, ensuring that no single force could dominate and allowing the universe to continue evolving in response to both internal conflicts and external threats. As the cosmere narrative unfolds, the rediscovery and wielding of the Dawnshards will determine whether the universe can achieve a new equilibrium or fall into chaos.\n\n* CHANGE will drive the cosmere‚Äôs ongoing evolution, enabling it to adapt to new challenges.\n* UNITE will be the force that brings together disparate realms, peoples, and powers, creating a cohesive whole.\n* SURVIVE will ensure the cosmere‚Äôs endurance, providing stability in the face of destruction.\n* DESTROY will clear away what no longer serves, making space for new growth and possibilities.\n\n# Dawnshards Imprint\n\nI finally think each Dawnshard has imprinted some of their Will on each of the Shards, below I have each Shard and the associated Dawnshard.\n\n# 1. CHANGE\n\n* **Mercy**: Embodies the transformative power of compassion and forgiveness, allowing individuals and societies to evolve and grow. Mercy encourages change through understanding and empathy, guiding shifts from one state to another by offering second chances and fostering healing. By enabling individuals to overcome past transgressions, Mercy drives significant personal and societal transformation, aligning with the essence of CHANGE.\n* **Endowment**: Focuses on bestowing gifts and granting power, fundamentally altering the recipient‚Äôs life. Endowment‚Äôs act of giving transforms individuals, fitting the theme of CHANGE.\n* **Whimsy**: Embodies unpredictability and spontaneity, leading to unexpected shifts in reality. Whimsy‚Äôs playful and erratic nature aligns with the inherent adaptability of CHANGE.\n* **Invention**: Represents the creation of new ideas and technology, transforming existing systems. Invention‚Äôs drive to innovate ties closely to the power of CHANGE to alter the status quo.\n\n# 2. UNITE\n\n* **Honor**: Central to the creation of bonds, oaths, and relationships. Honor‚Äôs Intent is about unification through shared ideals and commitments, directly aligning with the concept of UNITE.\n* **Devotion**: Centers on love, loyalty, and emotional connection, fostering strong bonds among individuals. Devotion‚Äôs emphasis on bringing people together through compassion fits well with UNITE.\n* **Dominion**: Focuses on control, order, and the consolidation of power. Dominion‚Äôs desire to unite realms under a structured authority ties into UNITE‚Äôs goal of cohesion.\n* **Virtuosity**: Embodies creativity as a unifying force, using art and expression to connect cultures and individuals. Virtuosity‚Äôs artistic bonding aligns with UNITE‚Äôs theme of bringing together disparate elements.\n\n# 3. SURVIVE\n\n* **Preservation**: Embodies the desire to maintain existence, ensuring things continue despite external pressures. Preservation‚Äôs focus on endurance and stability perfectly aligns with SURVIVE.\n* **Valor**: Represents courage and resilience, empowering individuals to face adversity and persist. Valor‚Äôs emphasis on standing firm in the face of challenges fits the theme of SURVIVE.\n* **Autonomy**: Focuses on maintaining independence and self-reliance, ensuring entities remain sovereign and survive without outside control. Autonomy‚Äôs drive for individuality supports SURVIVE‚Äôs goal of persistence.\n* **Cultivation**: Encourages adaptation and growth, allowing life to endure through change. Cultivation‚Äôs nurturing influence supports survival through evolution, connecting it with SURVIVE.\n\n# 4. DESTROY\n\n* **Ruin**: The Shard of decay and entropy, focused on breaking down structures and returning them to a simpler state. Ruin‚Äôs destructive nature aligns directly with the command of DESTROY.\n* **Odium**: Represents the destructive force of hatred, breaking down bonds and creating conflict. Odium‚Äôs drive for conquest and discord ties closely to the essence of DESTROY.\n* **Ambition**: Embodies the relentless pursuit of power, willing to destroy obstacles and barriers to achieve its goals. Ambition‚Äôs destructive tendencies to overcome align with DESTROY‚Äôs intent.\n* **Unknown (Possibly Prudence or Wisdom)**: A theoretical Shard that could fit within DESTROY‚Äôs domain by dismantling ignorance or harmful structures in a calculated, careful way, ensuring balance through strategic destruction.\n\n# ""}"

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'Romeo and Juliet: A precursor to transcendentalism? ', 'content': 'I just finished reading Romeo and Juliet and as much as I thought it would be about love and tragedy, I feel like the governing theme of the story was rejecting the cultural and societal norms of the time for the sake of individual freedom (with an asterisks\\*). A lot of the choices in the story can be reasoned with wanting to express individual freedoms, or repressing them in others for the sake of adhering to cultural norms.\n\nDuring the thick of the Italian Renaissance it\'s obvious that gender roles and social classes governed the cultures of the time. Juliet being born into the Capulet name essentially laid the framework of what her life would come to be. I think for her, the love and thought of being with Romeo was a big draw towards this unknown freedom and new narrative she could write for herself. In the story she repeatedly rejects the class-culture with her contempt towards marrying Paris. Additionally, the closing line of the play: ""For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and *her*Romeo"" suggests that Juliet truly took the reins of her narrative by pursuing *her* Romeo.\n\nFor Romeo, he rejects the notion that a man can\'t be emotional before other inherently ""masculine"" traits. Interestingly enough, Romeo seems to be a strong fighter having bested both Tybalt and Paris in duel, so physically he fits the masculine identity of the time. Conversely, Romeo\'s deep obsession for love, and then his deep obsession for Juliet was likely a foreign concept of the time which may paint him to be less masculine in that audiences\' eyes. The story highlights this contrast of what masculinity is in the opening scene with him sulking around while Gregory and Sampson are joking around about unwanted advances on women as a prize of besting the men of house Montague. Even though his emotions were entrapping, he was practicing a new found freedom to even have and express them-- almost a self reliance.\n\nI say that this is a precursor to transcendentalism because it doesn\'t quite meet the mark of what I think transcendentalism to be. Though the mere fact that this story has themes of rejecting societal norms for a sense of freedom (but not necessarily self reliance), shows that Shakespeare was trying to shed light on more progressive thoughts on life. Ultimately, it would take a couple more centuries for society to shift away from these gender and class roles, but in a way it planted an early seed. Shakespeare writes of this agency within restraint on progressiveness when Juliet says ""if he be married, my grave is like to be my wedding bed."" While Juliet is practicing the freedom to choose a man, she\'s freely choosing to entrap her life to a man. To the effect that she doesn\'t believe she has worth beyond being Romeo\'s wife, such that she would take her life if he were not around. Her passion and love might reflect the weather of the day, but the culture will still dictate the climate of the era.\n\nDo you feel like this is a fair assessment of a possible theme of the story? What are some other examples you see in the book of characters rejecting norms for the purpose of freedom or maybe even self reliance? Do you think other themes are more potent dictators of the course of the story?'}"

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'CMV: Human society would be better if hiding one\'s ""natural"" appearance was normalized', 'content': 'To clarify the title, by ""*hiding one\'s natural appearance*"" I mean using using clothing or other methods to conceal one\'s face, body, voice or any other superficial features that are part of the individual\'s body, and instead make themselves recognizable by features that they intentionally construct or choose.\n\nBy saying ""*human society would be better*"", I am proposing this as a hypothetical alternative to the current status quo, not a policy to enact on our current society. I am aware that trying to change from one social norm to another would be very difficult, but I don\'t think that\'s relevant to whether or not one norm or the other theoretically would be better. By ""*better*"", I mean a system that is more closely aligned with the values of reducing unnecessary conflict, and of human equality, freedom and opportunity for personal happiness and success.\n\nBy ""*normalized*"", I am not saying that it would be mandatory to do so or even necessarily socially discouraged to do otherwise, but that it will consistently be an option with no inherent social stigma, and that anyone not doing so will also be assumed to be doing so for a deliberate reason rather than just acting in the default manner.\n\nThe main reasons I believe this would be beneficial are the following:\n\n# It would allow individuals to have more privacy about certain superficial features, and reduce the social influence of those features.\n\nThis is the most basic and, as far as I can tell, most obvious benefit to this system. Going just by the appearances of someone\'s body, you can get a semi-reliable estimate of a person\'s age, some aspects of the genetic background of their biological ancestors, their gender and certain superficial health conditions. In a truly egalitarian society, there would be very few circumstances where you would need to know most of those details about a person, and no circumstances where you would need to know immediately after meeting someone and act solely on your initial estimate.\n\nIn our current system, however, those details form the basis of most of the most widespread and insidious forms of unfair prejudice, and it is largely based just on these immediate, superficial estimations to begin with. While this is sometimes in the form of categorical bigotry against certain groups, there is also many subtler, less conscious forms of bias against (or for) people due to their appearance. These can be general social advantages or disadvantages for people who are more conventionally attractive, or someone can perceive an individual as untrustworthy, dumb, dangerous or various other irrational judgments based on their face alone without really thinking about it.\n\nI will admit that, in many cases, a person\'s own perception of how significant these effects are can be out of touch with reality (which I\'ll touch on in a later point), but it would be naive to say that nobody in our current world judges books by their cover, or that those biases can\'t have effects on all levels ranging from social to romantic to professional. In any case, it would be beneficial to have the option to opt out of that sort of superficial perception when desired.\n\n# It would allow individuals to have more control over their own emotional expression, and reduce the social influence of involuntary, superficial emotional expression.\n\nThis will probably come off as a lot more unintuitive and controversial, since most people take it for granted that the existence of nonverbal emotional expressions (including, but not limited to, facial expressions) are a near-essential part of communication. In most cases, these expressions are involuntary and/or automatic, and can be accepted as honest and reliable. However, there are still a significant minority of cases where a person can have their expression interpreted incorrectly, or where they can intentionally misrepresent their emotions by controlling their expression.\n\nA system that doesn\'t rely on the assumption of the accuracy of these expressions would avoid many social issues caused by these cases, but it is also the case that this alone *might* not be enough to outweigh the losses to social ease and cohesion. In addition, though, I think it is good on its own for people to have the ability to choose what emotions they want to express and how, with the expectation being that this is an intentional choice. Aside from it being conventionally assumed in our current system, I don\'t see any reason why people should be obligated to disclose their emotions to others under all circumstances, and this is the practical consequence (if not purpose) of having the expectation of these expressions being freely visible.\n\n# It would give individuals a greater amount of personal agency over their life and identity.\n\nIn our current system, it is near-universal for people to internalize aspects of their appearance as part of their personal identity. In some ways, this is directly harmful. As I mentioned earlier, it is not uncommon for people to have an outsized perception of the significance of certain aspects of their appearance, and in many cases this can result in psychological complexes and issues with self-esteem, sometimes going all the way into body dysphoria depending on the individual. For others, this can be more neutral or even positive, but by attaching their identity to a physical object, which will inevitably change and age (frequently in ways that make it less conventionally attractive), they still make themselves vulnerable to crises of identity.\n\nBeyond that, though, even in cases where the person feels completely good about their appearance, they are still attributing personal significance to something outside of their control. In our current society, where one\'s appearance does (and/or can perceive to) affect other aspects of one\'s life, this can contribute to an externalized locus of control, which can then lead to feelings of helplessness, low motivation and low self-esteem. In a system where a person has much more control over the way they appear to the world, this would be reversed, and individuals would have much more reason to feel in control of their lives and identities.\n\nTo pre-empt some issues, I will also clarify a few things:\n\n* **I am aware that it is possible for people to change their appearance already.** I understand that there is makeup, clothing, exercise and so on. However, most of these options are very limited in their ability to change a person from their biologically-determined features, and the options that go further (such as extreme cosmetic surgery, masks that cover most of the face) are heavily stigmatized, practically inaccessible to most people, or both.\n* **I am** ***not*** **suggesting universal anonymity.** This would still be a society where people can be identified on sight, it would just potentially be through an appearance of their choice rather than by their ""natural"" features. In fact, to best take advantage of some of the previously-mentioned advantages, this social system would ideally encourage people to use uniquely personal imagery for their chosen appearance.\n* **This would naturally require other secondary social differences to function.** To connect to the previous bullet, there would of course need to be social norms and considerations when it comes to impersonating others or changing your appearance to make yourself unrecognisable and avoid consequences. This would, in my opinion, probably be good on its own. Our own system\'s overconfident reliance on immediate superficial features for identifying individuals is already the basis of a lot of frequent, serious practical problems, such as mistaken identification by eyewitnesses. Additionally, some forms of communication would probably have new ways of intentionally conveying emotion, but considering the existing variety of human language, I don\'t see this as a particularly major change, and it could have some of its own benefits.\n* **I understand that this itself is not ""natural"" behaviour for humans.** Humans have certain evolved behaviours when it comes to communication, romantic/sexual attraction and other social functions which rely on superficial appearances. However, I don\'t think this makes those behaviours good on their own. A lot of them are already practices we have been (gradually or rapidly) moving away from as our species has socially developed over time. For all of its issues, the rise of communication networks over the past few decades has shown that it is definitely possible for people to engage with each other an deep and varied levels even through text alone.\n* **I do not expect this to solve all social problems.** It\'s true that when it comes to superficial judgment, people can also have attitudes toward others based on their clothing, and realistically there are situations where an individual doesn\'t have complete control over those aspects of their appearance as well, either in terms of material limitations of pressure to conform. I do not, at least, expect this system to be *worse* than ours in any of those regards, and a system which emphasizes this form of identification more could feasibly have more opportunities to address those issues.\n* **I am most likely overlooking other potential consequences.** I\'ve brought up a few downsides and complications to this already, and I\'m sure there are more, but in order to change my view I would need to see that I have ignored a downside so serious, or so many collectively, that the drawbacks outweighs all the benefits. Alternatively, if you have any reason to believe that humans could never conceivably exist under this type of social system in the first place, and I agree with your reasoning, that would change my view.\n\nIf there\'s anything you think I\'ve failed to take into account, or anything I could clarify, please let me know. I may edit this post afterward to clarify things, or to note arguments I\'ve responded to, but I will not be changing any of my initial definitions to ""move the goalposts"" or anything like that.'}"

Where the choice was between player comfort and immersion, we have chosen player comfort for this implementation of Hardcore, but remain open to feedback as always.*\xa0\n\n*Let the penguins know your thoughts as we continue to monitor your reactions and feedback to this update.‚Äù*\n\n* Show only icons when seeing friendlies, name tags disabled.\n* Added and enabled a setting to remove the minimap entirely (as opposed to showing a disabled minimap widget).\n* Added and enabled a setting to allow players to access the Big Map (default input ""M"") even if the minimap is disabled. Orient and coordinate.\n* Added and enabled a setting to move the Squad List to the minimap\'s original position.\n* Added and enabled a setting to show a ""minimal"" version of the squad list with reduced information.\n* Added and enabled a setting that causes the inventory widget to be invisible.\n* Added and enabled a setting that causes the inventory widget to become visible when the player interacts with their loadout (and certain other actions), and subsequently become invisible again 2 seconds later.\n* Disabled crosshairs and hit markers for all infantry (hit confirmation audio remains active). Confirm your targets.\n* Added exceptions to crosshair disabling (Repair Tool retains its overheat element despite crosshairs being disabled).\n* Enabled a ""Realistic Audio"" mix that modifies the base audio environment (Slightly reduced ambiance, world sounds, soldier movement sounds. Slightly increased weapon audio, bullet passbys, impact loudness, explosions)\n\n\n\n# Vehicles:\n\n**Dev Comments:**\n\n‚Äú*We\'re trying to make vehicles terrifying, especially for unprepared groups and non-Engineer players, while ensuring their power fantasy is intact for pilots and passengers. This is largely achieved through survivability increases that synergize well with the faster Time To Kill in Hardcore.*\n\n*To counter the increased kill potential, vehicle weak points are more vulnerable than ever to well-positioned engineers, and the SOFLAM / Launcher team-up remains the gold standard for eliminating armor of all shapes and sizes (we see you, SOFLAM Recon mains).*‚Äú\n\n* Vehicle Maximum Health set to 1.4 (from default 1.0). Vehicles gain increased survivability in all engagement scenarios.\n* Vehicle Health Regeneration is disabled. Vehicles can now only be repaired using the Engineers\' Repair Tool, or with equipped Repair Systems.\n* Added and enabled a setting that causes vehicle Weak Spots to take increased damage from all sources (Doubled from default, leading to potentially devastating damage). Watch your six!\n* Increased velocity required to road-kill friendly teammates. Set to (15f) from default (0.5f). Enemies will still be roadkilled at the originally intended velocity.\n* Disabled the ability to trigger Anti-Tank Mines with friendly vehicles.\n* Added and disabled a contingency setting to completely remove the ability to road-kill friendlies.\n\n\n\n# Hardcore Mode rules:\n\n**Dev Comments:**\n\n*‚ÄúHardcore games, due to their increased rate of attrition, and our goal to provide more ""in the trenches"" combat close to objectives, have been assigned longer capture timers, more tickets, and increased time limits.‚Äù*\n\n* Increased match time limit for all Hardcore Modes to 60 minutes.\n* Doubled available tickets for both teams in all Hardcore Modes.\n* Flag Capture Time doubled. Die with your boots on.\n* Flag Neutralization Time doubled.\n\n\n\n# Battlefield Portal\n\n**New modifiers available in Portal that are not used in official Hardcore servers:**\n\n**Dev Comments:***‚ÄúIn the process of developing Hardcore, we\'ve experimented with a number of additional settings that didn\'t make the cut for our intended offering. We will ship these settings regardless, and they can be seen below, and accessed by players when creating their own Battlefield Portal experiences.*\n\n*The reasons for any exclusion, regardless of the setting itself, are largely the same: The modifier was deemed to be too difficult to understand / clearly explain during the natural flow of gameplay, or it damaged immersion without any commensurate addition to player comfort or quality of life.*\n\n*Some may have had an outsized impact on game balance, and were hence set to default.‚Äù*\n\nThese settings are available for use in Custom Experiences within Battlefield Portal and are **not** actively used on Official Hardcore Servers and matches.\n\n* Added a setting to award tickets on kill.\n* Added a setting to award tickets on downing an enemy.\n* Added a setting to award tickets for reviving friendly players.\n* Added a setting to award tickets for destroying vehicles.\n* Added a setting to penalize tickets when friendlies are sent to the downed or crawling state (as opposed to when they return to the deploy screen).\n* Added a setting to enable Ascension Points. This is a system that awards players points for in-game actions beneficial to their team. AP must then be spent to meritocratically access vehicles, instead of deploying them directly from the call-in menu or deploy screen. Vehicles have predefined AP prices, based on their combat effectiveness and utility.\n* Added a setting that subtracts Ascension Points on returning to the deploy screen after being downed.\n* Added a setting that awards players an amount of Ascension Points upon initial entry to the server.\n* Added a setting that sets a cap on how many Ascension Points players can hold at one moment in time.\n* Added a setting that can multiply recharge timers for infantry and vehicle skills that are able to self-replenish. These values are currently set to default within the builder.\n* Added a setting that can multiply the delay before weapons and abilities can automatically self-replenish. These values are currently set to default within the builder.\n\n**Additional Changes:**\n\n* Equipped badges are now shown first in the badge list.\n* Return to Sender - Now gives a score when the player interacts with an enemy grenade and throws it back.\n* Scoreboard - When a player causes Friendly Fire they will now lose points in the scoreboard and will receive a notification on the XP feed to indicate a loss of points.\n* Fixed an issue causing Javelin Mastery to show in the stats tab.\n\n  \n**Gameplay Flow & Social**:\n\n* Player card customization screen:\n   * Gameplay hints have a higher chance of showing on loading screen\n   * There will now be an in-game notification when you enter the deploy screen when saving of loadouts or weapon customization is disabled.\xa0\n\nDev Comments: ‚Äú*It has always been the case that when you play on a server where weapons or weapon attachments are restricted, we don\'t save any customization changes you make since you are forced to play with things you maybe normally don\'t want to and we don\'t want this to override your saved customization for normal matches.*\n\n*For example, if you\'re playing on a shotguns-only server we don\'t want that to override your recon loadout in normal matches. We‚Äôve now added a UI element to tell you when that is the case.*‚Äù\n\n* Customization / Deploy screen:\n   * Fixed a bug where input hints were misplaced on the event pass reward preview.\n   * Improved UI feedback when doing friendly fire. The kill skull has been replaced with a red X in that case and the kill log will also say when friendly fire damage reflection is enabled to show when you will start taking damage if you continue damaging friendlies.\n\n**Characters & Gadgets:**\n\n* Fixed a bug where the armor plate animation would loop if you tried to equip it while crouching in a CAV-Brawler open seat.\n\nDev Comments: *‚ÄúYou\'re not allowed to use the armor plate gadget while crouching, just like you\'re not allowed to shoot while crouching in that open seat.‚Äù*\n\n# Vehicles\n\n* UH 60 1P Camera FOV no longer changes with Soldier FOV.\n* You can no longer use zoom on 3P cam on UH-60.\n* Bradley IFV now gets spotted when driver or passenger fire any of the guns.\n* Adjusted vehicle radio volume depending on distance.\n* Fixed an issue where players could equip armor while sitting on the back seat of CAV-Brawler and get stuck on a looping equip animation.\n* RAM now uses the same repair system recharge time like the rest of tank categories, upped from 10 to 20.\n* UH-60 freelock sensitivity is now consistent with the rest of All Out Warfare Helicopters.\n* UH-60 repair system is now more efficient, heals 25hp in 5 seconds, from 10 hp in 8.6.\n* The gravity pull when UH-60 is near the ground has been lowered to be consistent with the rest of All Out Warfare Helicopters from 5m to 0.8m.\n* UH-60 miniguns have been tweaked to allow for effective burst fire, under constant fire this weapon will lose accuracy.\n* UH-60 minigun damage increased from 18 to 20.\n* UH-60 minigun damage drop off starts at 200 instead of 250.\n\n# \xa0Weapons\n\n* Fixed issues where zoom level stats in the collection screen were not showing correctly on Vault Weapons.\n* Improved reload sound effect on M1 Garand.\n* Added M1 Garand from Battlefield Portal.\n\nM1 Garand has seen various changes to fit in All Out Warfare including:\n\n* Adjustment to recoil, you will notice a much more aggressive recoil that becomes more managable on crouch or prone stances.\n* Increase\xa0 dispersion when firing while moving, jumping or sliding.\n* Increase in total magazines that you‚Äôre able to carry with the M1 Garand.\xa0\n* Adjusted damage model over distance to fit with rest of All Out Warfare weapons of the same category.\n* The M1 Garand clip now ejects to sides and not towards player camera.\n* Tightened the weapon alignment within center of screen during recoil and movement.\n\n*This announcement may change as we listen to community feedback and continue developing and evolving our Live Service & Content.

Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'Fentynal Guide To Quitting', 'content': 'Title: Understanding Fentanyl: Uses, Risks, and Controversies\n\nIntroduction:\nFentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, has gained significant attention in recent years due to its role in the opioid epidemic. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of fentanyl, including its medical uses, associated risks, and the controversies surrounding its widespread misuse.\n\nMedical Uses:\nOriginally developed for managing severe pain, especially in cancer patients, fentanyl is an analgesic that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. It is commonly used in medical settings for pain management during surgeries, chronic pain conditions, and palliative care.\n\nRisk Factors:\nWhile fentanyl is effective in controlling pain when administered under medical supervision, its misuse poses serious health risks. The drug\'s high potency increases the likelihood of overdose, leading to respiratory depression and, in extreme cases, death. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl, often mixed with other substances, has been a major contributor to the rising number of opioid-related deaths.\n\nControversies and Illicit Use:\nThe illicit use of fentanyl has sparked controversy and public health concerns. The drug is often clandestinely produced and added to other drugs, such as heroin or cocaine, without the user\'s knowledge. This has resulted in a surge in overdoses, as individuals may unintentionally consume lethal doses of the opioid.\n\nLaw Enforcement and Regulation:\nGovernments and law enforcement agencies worldwide are grappling with the challenges posed by the illicit production and distribution of fentanyl. Efforts to regulate its manufacturing and distribution are ongoing, with stricter controls in place to prevent diversion into illegal channels.\n\nTreatment and Harm Reduction:\nAddressing the fentanyl crisis requires a multi-faceted approach, including expanded access to addiction treatment, harm reduction strategies, and public awareness campaigns. Naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, has proven effective in reversing opioid overdoses and is increasingly available to first responders and the general public.\n\nConclusion:\nFentanyl, with its remarkable pain-relieving properties, has become a double-edged sword in the realm of healthcare. While it serves a crucial role in medical settings, its misuse poses severe risks to public health. Efforts to combat the opioid epidemic must focus on education, regulation, and treatment to strike a balance between managing pain effectively and preventing the tragic consequences of its illicit use.\n\nNarcan, also known by its generic name naloxone, is a medication used to rapidly reverse opioid overdose. It works by binding to the same receptors in the brain that opioids target, effectively reversing the life-threatening effects of opioid toxicity. Narcan is commonly administered in emergency situations where an individual is experiencing respiratory depression or unconsciousness due to opioid overdose.\n\nEmergency responders, healthcare professionals, and even some non-professionals, such as family members of individuals at risk of opioid overdose, may carry naloxone. The medication is available in various forms, including nasal sprays and injectable formulations, making it accessible for different situations.\n\nThe prompt administration of Narcan can restore normal breathing and consciousness, providing crucial time for the affected person to receive further medical attention. It is an essential tool in harm reduction strategies aimed at preventing opioid-related deaths and is a key component of public health initiatives addressing the opioid epidemic.\n\nSuboxone is a prescription medication used in the treatment of opioid dependence and addiction. It is a combination of two active ingredients: buprenorphine and naloxone.\n\n1. **Buprenorphine:** This is a partial opioid agonist, meaning it binds to the same receptors in the brain that opioids bind to but with less intensity. It helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, allowing individuals in recovery to better manage their addiction.\n\n2. **Naloxone:** Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist, which means it blocks the effects of opioids. When taken as directed, naloxone remains largely inactive. However, if someone were to misuse Suboxone by injecting it, the naloxone component can counteract the opioid effects, reducing the risk of misuse.\n\nSuboxone is often prescribed as part of medication-assisted treatment (MAT), a comprehensive approach to opioid addiction that includes counseling, therapy, and support services. It can be used in the detoxification phase as well as for long-term maintenance therapy. The goal of Suboxone treatment is to help individuals gradually reduce their dependence on opioids, manage cravings, and improve their overall quality of life during recovery.\n\nIt\'s important to note that Suboxone should only be used under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional, as improper use or abrupt discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms or other complications.\n\nPrecipitated withdrawal refers to the accelerated onset of withdrawal symptoms, often more severe than typical, when an opioid antagonist is introduced to the body. This occurs because the antagonist displaces the opioid from receptors, leading to a sudden and intense withdrawal reaction. \n\nFor example, if someone is currently dependent on opioids and receives a medication like naloxone or naltrexone, which are opioid antagonists, it can rapidly trigger withdrawal symptoms. This is a safety mechanism, as these medications are often used to reverse opioid overdose or as part of addiction treatment. \n\nThe term is commonly associated with medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder, where medications like buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist) are used. If buprenorphine is administered before other full opioids have cleared from the system, it can displace those opioids from receptors, leading to precipitated withdrawal. This is why healthcare providers carefully time the initiation of medications like buprenorphine to avoid this intensified withdrawal reaction.\n\nUnderstanding the potential for precipitated withdrawal is crucial in the context of addiction treatment to ensure safe and effective transitions between medications and to minimize discomfort for individuals in recovery.\n\nUsing Suboxone involves adherence to a specific treatment plan under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional. Here are some key aspects related to the use of Suboxone:\n\n1. **Prescription and Medical Supervision:** Suboxone is a prescription medication, and its use should be initiated and supervised by a qualified healthcare provider, typically in the context of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder.\n\n2. **Dosage:** The healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dosage based on the individual\'s specific needs and response to the medication. It\'s essential to follow the prescribed dosage and not adjust it without consulting the healthcare provider.\n\n3. **Administration:** Suboxone is often administered sublingually, meaning it is placed under the tongue and allowed to dissolve. This method allows for the absorption of the medication into the bloodstream.\n\n4. **Timing:** The timing of Suboxone administration is crucial. It is often started when the individual is in a mild to moderate state of withdrawal to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal. The healthcare provider will provide guidance on the appropriate timing.\n\n5. **Regular Monitoring:** During Suboxone treatment, individuals are regularly monitored by healthcare professionals to assess progress, manage side effects, and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n\n6. **Counseling and Support:** Suboxone is typically part of a comprehensive treatment plan that includes counseling, therapy, and support services. This holistic approach addresses both the physical and psychological aspects of opioid addiction.\n\n7. **Gradual Tapering:** Depending on the treatment plan, there may be a gradual tapering of Suboxone dosage as the individual progresses in their recovery. Tapering is done under medical supervision to minimize withdrawal symptoms.\n\n8. **Avoiding Other Opioids:** It\'s crucial to avoid the use of other opioids while taking Suboxone. Combining opioids can lead to dangerous interactions and diminish the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\n9. **Side Effects and Reporting:** Like any medication, Suboxone may have side effects. Common side effects include headache, nausea, and constipation. Any unusual or severe side effects should be promptly reported to the healthcare provider.\n\n10. **Pregnancy Considerations:** If an individual is pregnant or planning to become pregnant, it\'s important to discuss this with the healthcare provider, as the use of Suboxone during pregnancy requires careful consideration.\n\nAlways follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and inform them of any concerns or changes in your condition during Suboxone treatment. Successful recovery often involves a combination of medication, counseling, and support tailored to individual needs.\n\nSuboxone, when used as prescribed under the supervision of a healthcare professional as part of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder, has a lower potential for abuse and addiction compared to full opioid agonists. This is because Suboxone contains buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, which has a ceiling effect on its opioid effects.\n\nBuprenorphine\'s partial agonist properties mean that it activates opioid receptors in the brain to a lesser extent than full agonists like heroin or oxycodone. As a result, the euphoria and respiratory depression associated with opioid abuse are less pronounced with buprenorphine.\n\nHowever, it\'s essential to emphasize that any medication, including Suboxone, should be taken exactly as prescribed by a healthcare professional. Misuse, such as taking larger doses or combining Suboxone with other substances, can increase the risk of dependence or addiction.\n\nAbruptly stopping Suboxone can lead to withdrawal symptoms, emphasizing the importance of a gradual tapering plan under medical supervision when discontinuing the medication. It\'s crucial for individuals using Suboxone to work closely with their healthcare provider to ensure proper management of their opioid use disorder and to address any concerns or side effects during the course of treatment.\n\nWithdrawal symptoms from Suboxone, or buprenorphine (the active ingredient in Suboxone), can occur when someone who has been using the medication for an extended period stops taking it abruptly. It\'s important to note that withdrawal symptoms can vary in intensity and duration based on factors such as the individual\'s overall health, the duration of Suboxone use, and the dosage.\n\nCommon withdrawal symptoms from Suboxone may include:\n\n1. **Nausea and vomiting**\n2. **Diarrhea**\n3. **Muscle aches and pains**\n4. **Sweating**\n5. **Insomnia or sleep disturbances**\n6. **Anxiety**\n7. **Irritability**\n8. **Runny nose and teary eyes**\n9. **Goosebumps (piloerection)**\n10. **Dilated pupils**\n\nIt\'s important to distinguish between withdrawal symptoms and precipitated withdrawal. Precipitated withdrawal can occur if someone takes Suboxone too soon after using a full opioid agonist, leading to a more rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms.\n\nWithdrawal from Suboxone is generally considered less severe than withdrawal from full opioid agonists, and the symptoms tend to peak within the first 72 hours after discontinuation. However, the duration and severity can vary from person to person.\n\nIf an individual is considering stopping Suboxone or adjusting their dosage, it\'s crucial to do so under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Tapering the medication gradually, rather than stopping abruptly, can help minimize withdrawal symptoms and increase the chances of a successful transition to recovery. Seeking support from healthcare providers, counselors, and support groups is essential during this process.\n\nKratom is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, specifically in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Myanmar. The leaves of the Kratom tree have been traditionally used for various purposes, including as a stimulant, a pain reliever, and to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms.\n\nThe active compounds in Kratom, called alkaloids, interact with opioid receptors in the brain, producing effects that can vary depending on the strain and dosage. These effects can include:\n\n1. **Stimulation:** At lower doses, Kratom may act as a stimulant, promoting increased energy, alertness, and sociability.\n\n2. **Sedation:** At higher doses, Kratom may have sedative effects, leading to relaxation and pain relief.\n\n3. **Pain Relief:** Kratom has been used traditionally for its analgesic properties, and some people use it as a natural remedy for pain.\n\n4. **Mood Enhancement:** Some users report improved mood and reduced anxiety after consuming Kratom.\n\nHowever, it\'s important to note that Kratom is not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and its safety and effectiveness for various uses have not been clinically proven. There are potential risks associated with Kratom use, including dependence, addiction, and adverse effects such as nausea, constipation, and increased heart rate.\n\nDue to these concerns, Kratom has been a subject of regulatory scrutiny in various countries, with some regions imposing restrictions or outright bans on its sale and use. It is essential for individuals to exercise caution, seek reliable information, and consult with healthcare professionals before considering the use of Kratom, especially for medicinal purposes or to manage opioid withdrawal.\n\nMethadone is a synthetic opioid medication used primarily in the treatment of opioid dependence, particularly in the context of medication-assisted treatment (MAT). It is a long-acting opioid agonist, meaning it activates the same opioid receptors in the brain that other opioids, like heroin or morphine, do.\n\nKey points about Methadone include:\n\n1. **Opioid Dependence Treatment:** Methadone is often used as a maintenance medication to help individuals reduce or quit the use of illicit opioids. It helps by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms.\n\n2. **Long-Lasting Effect:** One significant advantage of methadone is its long duration of action. A single daily dose can help stabilize individuals, preventing the highs and lows associated with short-acting opioids.\n\n3. **Supervised Administration:** In some cases, methadone is provided through supervised administration in specialized clinics to ensure proper use and minimize the risk of diversion.\n\n4. **Tolerance and Dependence:** Like other opioids, individuals using methadone can develop tolerance and dependence. Therefore, the dosage needs to be carefully managed, and discontinuation should be done gradually under medical supervision.\n\n5. **Reduction of Illicit Drug Use:** When used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan, methadone has been shown to reduce illicit opioid use, lower the risk of overdose, and improve overall health outcomes.\n\n6. **Potential Side Effects:** Methadone can have side effects, including constipation, sweating, drowsiness, and changes in libido. It\'s important for individuals to report any adverse effects to their healthcare provider.\n\n7. **Regulated Use:** The use of methadone is tightly regulated, and it is typically dispensed through specialized clinics or healthcare providers who are authorized to prescribe it for opioid use disorder treatment.\n\nMethadone treatment is part of a broader approach that often includes counseling, therapy, and support services. It has been a valuable tool in harm reduction strategies aimed at addressing the opioid epidemic and helping individuals achieve and maintain recovery.\n\nNarcotics Anonymous (NA) is a 12-step program that provides support for individuals recovering from addiction, particularly those struggling with substance abuse issues. It is important to note that NA, like other 12-step programs, does not have an official stance or opinion on specific medical treatments, including medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for withdrawal.\n\nThe approach to medication assistance in withdrawal can vary among individuals within the NA community. Some may find success and support in MAT, while others may choose alternative methods or prefer an abstinence-based approach. NA encourages individuals to share their experiences, strength, and hope, but it does not dictate specific treatment choices.\n\nThe primary focus of NA is on mutual support, fellowship, and following the 12-step principles, which include admitting powerlessness over addiction, seeking spiritual awakening, and helping others in recovery. Members of NA are encouraged to respect each other\'s choices and paths to recovery.\n\nIt\'s essential for individuals seeking support for addiction to find a treatment plan that aligns with their needs and values. Consulting with healthcare professionals, attending support groups, and considering various treatment options can be part of a comprehensive approach to recovery.\n\nSMART Recovery (Self-Management and Recovery Training) is a science-based, secular alternative to traditional 12-step programs like Narcotics Anonymous. SMART Recovery emphasizes self-empowerment and utilizes evidence-based techniques to support individuals in overcoming addiction.\n\nRegarding Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT), SMART Recovery takes a neutral stance. The program acknowledges that MAT, when prescribed and monitored by healthcare professionals, can be a valid and effective part of a comprehensive approach to addiction treatment. SMART Recovery recognizes that different individuals may have unique needs, and treatment plans should be tailored to the individual\'s circumstances.\n\nSMART Recovery\'s focus is on teaching self-reliance, coping skills, and strategies for managing urges and behaviors associated with addiction. The program encourages participants to make informed decisions about their recovery, including the consideration of medications that may be prescribed by healthcare providers.\n\nUltimately, SMART Recovery emphasizes a holistic and individualized approach to recovery, allowing participants to choose the methods and tools that best suit their needs and align with their values. This includes being open to the potential benefits of MAT for some individuals as part of their overall recovery plan.\n\nSeveral treatment modalities are available for individuals struggling with opioid use disorder. The most effective approach often involves a combination of different strategies. Here are some key treatment modalities for opioid addiction:\n\n1. **Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT):** MAT involves the use of medications, such as methadone, buprenorphine (Suboxone), and naltrexone, to help manage cravings, reduce withdrawal symptoms, and support recovery. These medications are often used in combination with counseling and therapy.\n\n2. **Counseling and Behavioral Therapies:** Various forms of counseling and behavioral therapies are crucial components of opioid addiction treatment. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), contingency management, motivational enhancement therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) are among the approaches used to address the psychological aspects of addiction and help individuals develop coping skills.\n\n3. **Support Groups and 12-Step Programs:** Participating in support groups like Narcotics Anonymous (NA) or 12-step programs can provide valuable peer support, encouragement, and a sense of community for individuals in recovery.\n\n4. **Detoxification Programs:** Medically supervised detoxification programs help individuals safely manage the acute withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping opioid use. These programs often serve as the initial phase of treatment.\n\n5. **Residential or Inpatient Treatment:** Inpatient treatment programs provide a structured and supportive environment for individuals to focus on recovery. These programs may include a combination of medical supervision, counseling, and therapeutic activities.\n\n6. **Outpatient Treatment:** Outpatient programs allow individuals to receive treatment while living at home. This flexibility can be beneficial for those with work or family commitments. Outpatient treatment often includes counseling, therapy, and medication management.\n\n7. **Holistic and Alternative Therapies:** Some individuals find benefit from holistic approaches, such as acupuncture, yoga, meditation, or mindfulness practices. These can complement traditional treatment modalities and contribute to overall well-being.\n\n8. **Peer Recovery Support Services:** Peer recovery support services involve individuals with lived experience in recovery providing support, guidance, and encouragement to others going through similar challenges.\n\nThe most effective treatment plans are often individualized, taking into account the specific needs, preferences, and circumstances of each person. Collaborating with healthcare professionals to develop a comprehensive and tailored approach can significantly enhance the chances of successful recovery from opioid addiction.\n\nThe withdrawal timeline for fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, can vary among individuals based on factors such as the duration and intensity of use, individual metabolism, and overall health. Fentanyl withdrawal symptoms typically start shortly after the last dose and follow a general timeline:\n\n1. **Early Symptoms (Within a few hours):** Early withdrawal symptoms may include anxiety, restlessness, sweating, and increased heart rate. Individuals may also experience muscle aches and insomnia.\n\n2. **Peak Intensity (24-72 hours):** Withdrawal symptoms usually peak within the first 24 to 72 hours after discontinuing fentanyl. During this time, individuals may experience more intense symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, dilated pupils, and flu-like symptoms.\n\n3. **Subsiding Symptoms (5-7 days):** The most acute withdrawal symptoms generally begin to subside within about five to seven days. However, some symptoms, such as insomnia, anxiety, and mood swings, may persist for a more extended period.\n\n4. **Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS):** Some individuals may experience a more prolonged period of withdrawal symptoms known as post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS). This can include lingering psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. PAWS can persist for weeks or even months.\n\nIt\'s crucial to note that fentanyl withdrawal can be challenging, and seeking professional help is recommended to manage symptoms safely and effectively. Medical supervision can provide support through the detoxification process, and healthcare professionals may use medications to alleviate specific withdrawal symptoms and improve the overall comfort of the individual.\n\nThe withdrawal process is highly individual, and some individuals may find additional support through counseling, therapy, and participation in support groups to address the psychological aspects of recovery. Always consult with healthcare professionals for guidance on the safest and most effective approach to fentanyl withdrawal.\n\nXylazine is a veterinary sedative and analgesic medication. It belongs to the class of drugs known as alpha-2 adrenergic agonists. While it is primarily intended for veterinary use, xylazine has been misused in some cases for recreational purposes, particularly in combination with other substances.\n\nIn veterinary medicine, xylazine is commonly used as a sedative and muscle relaxant for various procedures, including surgery and diagnostic imaging. It is often administered to calm and immobilize animals.\n\nHowever, the use of xylazine outside of veterinary settings, especially when combined with other drugs, can pose serious health risks. Misuse of xylazine has been associated with adverse effects, including respiratory depression, cardiovascular issues, and central nervous system depression.\n\nIt\'s important to emphasize that the use of xylazine for recreational purposes is highly dangerous and illegal. The drug is not intended for human consumption, and its effects can be unpredictable and potentially life-threatening.\n\nIf you have concerns about substance use or encounter situations involving illicit drugs, it is crucial to seek help from healthcare professionals, addiction specialists, or local support services. Misuse of veterinary drugs or any substances not prescribed for human use can have severe consequences and should be avoided.\n\nPAWS stands for Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome. It refers to a set of prolonged withdrawal symptoms that some individuals may experience after the acute phase of withdrawal from substances like opioids, benzodiazepines, or alcohol. PAWS is not limited to a specific substance and can occur with various drugs.\n\nThese symptoms are generally more subtle than the acute withdrawal symptoms but can persist for weeks, months, or, in some cases, years after discontinuing substance use. PAWS can vary widely among individuals and may include symptoms such as:\n\n1. **Mood swings**\n2. **Anxiety**\n3. **Irritability**\n4. **Insomnia**\n5. **Fatigue**\n6. **Difficulty concentrating**\n7. **Memory problems**\n8. **Reduced impulse control**\n9. **Cravings for the substance**\n\nPAWS can be challenging for individuals in recovery, as these lingering symptoms may contribute to relapse if not effectively managed. Supportive interventions, such as counseling, therapy, and participation in support groups, can be beneficial for individuals experiencing PAWS. Healthy lifestyle choices, including regular exercise, proper nutrition, and adequate sleep, may also contribute to the overall well-being of those in recovery.\n\nIt\'s important to note that PAWS is not experienced by everyone in recovery, and its severity and duration can vary. Seeking guidance from healthcare professionals or addiction specialists can assist individuals in managing PAWS and maintaining long-term recovery.\n\nQuitting substance use ""cold turkey"" involves stopping the use of a substance abruptly without tapering or gradually reducing the dosage. It\'s important to note that quitting cold turkey can be challenging, and the level of difficulty varies depending on the substance, the duration and intensity of use, and individual factors.\n\nIf you\'re considering quitting a substance cold turkey, here are some general recommendations:\n\n1. **Seek Professional Guidance:** Before making the decision to quit cold turkey, it\'s advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or addiction specialist. They can provide guidance based on your specific situation, assess potential risks, and offer support.\n\n2. **Create a Support System:** Inform friends, family, or a support network about your decision to quit. Having a support system in place can provide encouragement, understanding, and assistance during challenging times.\n\n3. **Understand Withdrawal Symptoms:** Be aware of potential withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting the substance cold turkey. Withdrawal symptoms can vary depending on the substance but may include anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and other physical or psychological effects.\n\n4. **Stay Hydrated and Nourished:** Maintaining proper hydration and nutrition is crucial during the quitting process. Stay hydrated by drinking water and consuming a balanced diet to support your overall well-being.\n\n5. **Exercise:** Engage in regular physical activity. Exercise can help alleviate stress, improve mood, and contribute to your overall physical and mental health.\n\n6. **Consider Professional Treatment:** Depending on the substance and the severity of dependence, professional treatment options, such as inpatient or outpatient programs, may be beneficial. Medical supervision can assist in managing withdrawal symptoms and ensuring safety.\n\n7. **Therapy and Counseling:** Consider participating in therapy or counseling to address the underlying factors contributing to substance use and to develop coping strategies for a successful recovery.\n\n8. **Plan for Triggers:** Identify situations, environments, or emotions that may trigger the urge to use the substance. Develop a plan to cope with these triggers without resorting to substance use.\n\nIt\'s essential to approach quitting any substance with a comprehensive strategy, and individual circumstances vary. Seeking professional advice ensures that you make informed decisions about the best approach for your specific situation. If you are experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms or have concerns about quitting cold turkey, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for guidance and support.\n\nTapering refers to the gradual reduction of the dosage of a substance, typically a medication or a drug, over a specific period. Tapering is commonly used in the context of addiction treatment, where it involves slowly decreasing the amount of a substance to manage withdrawal symptoms and minimize the risks associated with abrupt discontinuation.\n\nKey points about tapering include:\n\n1. **Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT):** Tapering is often part of medication-assisted treatment for substance use disorders. For example, individuals dependent on opioids might undergo a gradual tapering of medications like methadone or buprenorphine.\n\n2. **Reducing Dependence:** Tapering is employed to reduce physical dependence on a substance by allowing the body to adjust to lower levels gradually. This helps minimize the severity of withdrawal symptoms.\n\n3. **Individualized Approach:** Tapering plans are typically individualized based on factors such as the substance used, the duration and intensity of use, and the individual\'s overall health. Healthcare professionals design tapering schedules to meet the specific needs of each person.\n\n4. **Supervised Tapering:** Tapering is ideally done under the supervision of a healthcare professional to ensure safety and effectiveness. This is particularly important in cases where abrupt discontinuation could lead to severe withdrawal symptoms or complications.\n\n5. **Psychological Support:** Tapering is not only about physical adjustments but also addresses psychological aspects of dependence. It provides individuals with an opportunity to develop coping skills and strategies for managing life without reliance on the substance.\n\n6. **Preventing Relapse:** Gradual tapering can help reduce the risk of relapse by easing the transition to complete abstinence. It gives individuals the time and support needed to adjust to life without the substance.\n\nTapering is a careful and structured process that should be guided by healthcare professionals. Abruptly stopping certain substances can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms and potential health risks. Seeking professional advice and support is crucial for a safe and successful tapering process, whether it\'s part of addiction treatment or the discontinuation of a prescribed medication.\n\nEngaging in activities during withdrawal can help distract from symptoms, provide a sense of accomplishment, and contribute to overall well-being. Here are some ideas for keeping busy during withdrawal:\n\n1. **Reading:** Escape into a good book or explore topics of interest to keep your mind occupied.\n\n2. **Movies or TV Shows:** Watch movies or binge-watch a TV series to pass the time. Choose lighthearted or inspirational content.\n\n3. **Exercise:** Engage in gentle exercises like walking, yoga, or stretching. Exercise can help improve mood and alleviate some withdrawal symptoms.\n\n4. **Creative Hobbies:** Explore creative outlets such as drawing, painting, writing, or playing a musical instrument.\n\n5. **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Practice mindfulness or meditation techniques to calm the mind and reduce stress.\n\n6. **Gardening:** Spend time outdoors, tending to a garden or plants. Nature can have a positive impact on mood.\n\n7. **Puzzle Games:** Solve puzzles, play Sudoku, or engage in other mentally stimulating games.\n\n8. **Listening to Music or Podcasts:** Create playlists of your favorite music or listen to podcasts on topics of interest.\n\n9. **Cooking or Baking:** Experiment with new recipes and treat yourself to nourishing meals.\n\n10. **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings. Keeping a journal can be therapeutic during withdrawal.\n\n11. **Educational Courses:** Take online courses or watch educational videos on platforms like Coursera or Khan Academy.\n\n12. **Board Games or Card Games:** Play board games or cards with friends or family for some social interaction.\n\n13. **Self-Care Activities:** Take relaxing baths, practice skincare routines, or indulge in other self-care activities to nurture your well-being.\n\n14. **Volunteering:** If possible, consider volunteering for a cause you\'re passionate about. Helping others can be rewarding.\n\n15. **Stay Connected:** Reach out to friends and family for support. Having a support system is crucial during withdrawal.\n\nIt\'s important to choose activities that align with your interests and energy levels. Remember that withdrawal is a challenging time, and it\'s okay to prioritize self-care. If symptoms become severe or unmanageable, seeking professional help is recommended.'}"
Reddit,RELIANCE,"{'title': 'How do I humanise this text??', 'content': '# 1) Ethical Dilemmas in Redesigning Public Transit Systems\n\nThe ethical dilemmas in redesigning public transit systems include:\n\n* **Equity**: Will the redesigned system equally benefit all segments of the population, or will it favor certain groups over others, such as wealthier areas versus underserved communities?\n* **Autonomy**: How will the introduction of autonomous buses affect employment for transit workers? Could it lead to job losses or reduced wages?\n* **Safety**: How reliable and safe are the autonomous vehicles? What happens if the technology fails or malfunctions?\n* **Public Consent**: Were all stakeholders, especially those in underserved areas, adequately consulted? Do they have a voice in shaping the changes that directly impact their daily lives?\n* **Environmental Responsibility**: Will the redesigned system truly promote sustainability, or will it introduce other environmental risks or inefficiencies?\n\n# 2) Engineering as Social Experimentation in the Transit Redesign Project\n\nThe concept of **engineering as social experimentation** applies because the project introduces new technologies (autonomous buses) and changes to societal infrastructure (transit routes), directly affecting public behavior and daily life. The city‚Äôs population effectively becomes part of an experiment to see how these changes will impact urban mobility, accessibility, and social dynamics. Since the outcomes, particularly social and behavioral responses, are uncertain, the project becomes a form of social experimentation.\n\n# 3) Potential Social, Economic, and Environmental Impacts\n\n* **Social Impacts**: Vulnerable communities may either benefit from improved accessibility or suffer from unintended exclusions if the new routes and technologies do not adequately serve their needs. Public confidence in autonomous vehicles may also vary, creating trust issues.\n* **Economic Impacts**: The automation of buses could lead to job losses for drivers and support staff, disproportionately affecting lower-income workers. Conversely, it may create new jobs in technology, vehicle maintenance, and oversight, but these roles may require specialized skills.\n* **Environmental Impacts**: If successful, the project could reduce traffic congestion, lower emissions, and promote more sustainable urban development. However, environmental risks could arise if the autonomous technology or bus manufacturing processes are resource-intensive or if there‚Äôs an over-reliance on electricity from non-renewable sources.\n\n# 4) Ethical Principles Guiding Decisions\n\nThe ethical principles that should guide engineers and policymakers include:\n\n* **Justice and Fairness**: Ensure that the redesign provides equitable access and benefits all communities, particularly underserved ones.\n* **Transparency**: Communicate openly with the public about the risks, benefits, and uncertainties of the changes.\n* **Public Welfare**: Prioritize the safety, health, and well-being of the entire population, making sure the technological innovations do not introduce harm.\n* **Sustainability**: Aim for long-term environmental sustainability, ensuring that the project contributes to the reduction of carbon footprints and the protection of natural resources.\n\n# 5) Framework for Ethical Decision-Making\n\nA comprehensive framework for ethical decision-making in this context should include:\n\n* **Risk Assessment**: Engineers should conduct thorough assessments of the potential risks, including technological failures, social inequality, and environmental degradation.\n* **Stakeholder Engagement**: Incorporate input from a wide range of stakeholders, including public officials, community members (especially those in underserved areas), transportation workers, and environmental groups.\n* **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Evaluate the economic, social, and environmental costs versus the benefits of the proposed changes, making sure that the benefits are distributed equitably and that the risks are minimized.\n* **Monitoring and Adaptation**: The project should include mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and the flexibility to adapt the system based on real-world outcomes. If unintended consequences arise, corrective actions should be swiftly implemented.\n* **Ethical Oversight**: Establish an independent ethical review board to periodically assess the project‚Äôs progress and ensure that it adheres to the core ethical principles.\n\nBy using this framework, engineers and policymakers can ensure that decisions are made transparently and ethically, taking into account both immediate and long-term effects on the city‚Äôs population.'}"

However, BLG's individual skill is unmatched, and WBG would only be able win with major gaps in draft\n\nbut their tactics of opening yone aurora on red won't go so easily against BLG after they've used it so many times, and with no stable picks to dominate the game with, they won't match up against BLG's individual skill\n\nDaeny ain't got no ingredients to cook with this time around.\n\n# main analysis starts here\n\nquick TLDR of that quarterfinals video:\n\nThe initial meta established after swiss stage was to draft around creating number advantages and fighting in situations where you had to fight down numbers\n\nthis is because overall champion damage has significantly decreased from last year, and therefore one champ who is giga fed can't solo carry the game anymore\n\nthis causes overall numbers advantage to be a lot more important\n\nfeatures of this worlds include longer death timers, champs being weak at first item(especially adc), boots nerfed causing champions to be weak at roaming, fleet/sustain nerfed meaning champs are worse at staying in lane, as well as only 6 grubs and soul/baron/elder being must contest objectives.\n\n# Seminifinals video starts here:\n\nthere has been a lot of development and evolution of meta reads of teams since swiss stage\n\n# review of quarters\n\n# Upper bracket:\n\nLNG and HLE kept their old style of fighting around number advantages since swiss stage, while BLG and WBG both chose teamfighting comps.\n\nTherefore, the entire upper bracket became a clash between the meta read of numbers advantage and traditional teamfighting.\n\nThe result is that HLE and LNG both were surprisingly knocked out.\n\nLNG's loss was a bit sad; their mental completely exploded. the first 2 games they lost they had the comp of nocturne ahri with adc like jhin kaisa that created number advantages\n\nwhy this comp works and correlates with meta is explained in his last video (my last post)\n\nand this comp indeed was useful in these 2 games, establishing a big gold advantage for LNG.\n\nHowever, when faced against this, WBG did the exact same thing in these 2 games: start baron, and force LNG to come teamfight.\n\nWBG's comp is certainly better at teamfighting than LNG, and LNG couldn't use how flexible the comp was to pick off people when the fight is around baron.\n\ngame 1, WBG start baron while down 3000 gold and got it all back in one fight\n\nsecond game, they were down 4000+ but one baron teamfight ended the game\n\nthe decision to rush baron in both games was most likely prepared and this is WBG's counter to the comp around number advantage\n\nHLE and BLG's game went similarly;\n\ngame 1 HLE played a textbook numbers game, with every teamfight being able to utilise Alistar's Ult being able to tank many members and poppy ult being able to create advantages in number\n\nBLG didn't take a single even teamfight\n\nfrom game 2, BLG realised this\n\ndifferent to WBG's style of forcing teamfights around major objectives, BLG just complete mechanic checked them\n\nfrom lane to teamfight, Doran was completely outmatched\n\nBLG didn't care what kind of fight it was, they would engage brainlessly and start a fight whereever they could\n\nthis is why it was such a Cinema game\n\nthey dragged HLE into their own tempo and completely fisted them\n\n# review of upper bracket\n\nso, we do need to doubt the meta read of numbers advantage, especially since both LNG and HLE lost on it\n\nthe comp seems very not tolerant for mistakes, as if you can't keep the snowball rolling and find opportunities, when it comes to teamfights, these comps are not as strong as the pure traditional teamfight comps\n\nthat was their initial conclusion\n\nHOWEVER\n\nT1 gave a completely different answer in the lower bracket\n\n# lower bracket\n\nLet's coin T1's style numbers advantage 2.0\n\nT1's swiss meta read was not about numbers advantage at all, but pure teamfighting\n\nchamps like vi, leona, traditional teamfighting champs\n\nagainst TES, however, their meta read turned a full 180 towards the numbers advantage comp\n\nthey also topped off the comp with their style: Keria's roaming supports\n\ngame 1, faker's first blood was because of Keria's roam\n\ngame 2, the first blood at grubs was also Keria's rakan roam\n\nand game 3, they even picked pyke and again first blood was Keria's roam with faker\n\nKeria was like a rat (xdd) this series, appearing everywhere\n\nGuma's picks turned from supportive adc such as ashe, jhin into carry adc that require at least 2 items like caitlyn, xayah\n\nthis makes sense; worlds patch IE was not nerfed yet, but ADC first items have been nerfed; bork nerfed, shiv nerfed, kraken nerfed, even dorans blade was nerfed.\n\nThis caused adc being very weak at one item\n\nadditionally, these items of kraken, bork, ie have no crit\n\nthis means that if an adc really wanted to spike at one item, then they will be a lot weaker at two items than two pure crit items, only being as useful at three full items\n\nso, rather than forcing adc to pick functional like jhin ashe to make up for their early game weakness, they could just leave adc alone in lane to farm until their pre-nerf IE two items.\n\nAnd because of adc lacking damage early game, the enemy team's adc and support alone can't dive guma 1v2, especially the later games when guma was playing xayah\n\nthey would at least need a jungler as well, but this situation is impossible in pro play as it would be easily readable and T1 can easily respond either by defending the dive or mirroring the play top side\n\nand again, since adc is weak early, plays around top side will be a lot more worth than bot side, so it would be never worth for TES to attract their attention bot side\n\nHowever, this meant that only one choice was left, for both adcs to be alone in lane and for meiko to match the roam\n\nbut then, how can a slow and stupid leona match keria's champs that were picked specifically for roaming?\n\nadditionally, T1 have galio and poppy on top side which can easily create advantages in number\n\nthis creates a dead loop for TES; T1 only fights with number advantage top side; they wouldn't fight at all if they didn't have extra people or couldn't pick off players\n\nif they stall until late, T1's caitlyn xayah will certainly be a lot stronger than TES's adcs\n\nfor example, in game 1, even when T1 had advantage, when creme had a item lead, they would instantly give dragon and not fight\n\nagain, this meta, except for 6 grubs and soul/elder/baron, everything else can be given\n\nthey waited all the way until caitlyn's items were online and then teamfighted\n\n**So could T1's comp be countered by replicating WBG's strats of forcing baron?**\n\nTES did realise this.\n\nin game 1, TES instantly went to force baron. Creme's tristana already had the core items, with iverns bushes, the force should be op.\n\nHowever, Keria is bard. The bard ult easily stops TES's attempts at forcing baron\n\neven in game 2 and 3, T1's comp has champs that can stop baron\n\ngame 2's rumble, game 3's poppy\n\nbut T1 already smashed TES in early game so these weren't put into use\n\ndiffererent to LNG and HLE's reliance on nocturne ult to create number advantages, roaming supports are more able to create plays early and can free the jungle role to pick more fighting champs like poppy or xin zhao\n\nthis means that they can easily get grubs\n\nall in all, it seems that T1's style is most fitting to this year's worlds meta.\n\nNow GenG.\n\nGenG's understanding this bo5 was very different to the other 3 bo5\n\nnothing new is taken out; when you thought GenG would take out their trap card in game 5, they reversed time and locked in smolder\n\nGenG's performance these games are similar to last year, being very early to progress from swiss but inventing nothing new\n\nThis year they matched against FLY, who are strong, but strong to a point\n\nlike last year they got completely taken out by BLG, this year's bo5, the only new thing they brought out is kassadin, which was obviously prepared to counter sylas\n\neven with no sylas, the mid jg was both ap so kassadin was picked\n\nhowever, this pick was practiced with a very shallow mind\n\nthey have even given up the nocturne comp that they relied on to progress from swiss\n\nwhen it matters, double adc, smolder, zzz\n\ntheir opponent FLY tho, they were many more times more active than GenG because they are also drafting around number advantages\n\ngame 1, they have global ult with galio, long range engage with ashe seraphine, using this cc chain many times in the game to engage fights\n\ngame 2, they even picked nunu to run around the map\n\ngame 3, even though it looks like they are playing double adc like GenG summer meta, their double adc is fundamentally differerent to GenG's in that zeri kaisa are both champs that have very long range movement abilities which allow them to quickly reposition and flexibly choose who to focus down\n\nmatched with a skarner that can drift through walls and a flying rakan, this supposed slow and dumb double adc comp was a lot more flexible and quick than GenG\n\nin the final game, they even came out with the unorthodox fiddlesticks jungle that is amazing at picks, wanting to cc chain sides with yone\n\nthey lost on individual skill, but their efforts were valiant\n\nGenG, however, when they are behind, they start believing in themselves and going back to their previous comfort zones, winning through individual skill\n\nagainst T1, their top side will have to play against the pressure of 4 players from T1, canyon can't exactly pick nidalee games and chovy can't pick kassadin/smolder, champs that cannot contest early games anymore.\n\n# semifinals predictions\n\n# lower bracket\n\n# T1 3:0 or 3:1 GenG\n\nagainst T1, their top side will have to play against the pressure of 4 players from T1, canyon can't exactly pick nidalee games and chovy can't pick kassadin/smolder, champs that cannot contest early games anymore.\n\nthis lower bracket bo5 is a clash of comps; T1's number advantage 2.0 designed around their champ pool and individual skill, vs GenG's 10 win streak turtle style. There will be a clear winner between these two styles, meaning that it is very easy for the series to be one sided.\n\nT1's understanding is more fitting to the meta, so T1 will probably take the series.\n\n# upper bracket\n\n# BLG 3:0 or 3:1 WBG\n\nif lower bracket is a clash of two comps, the upper bracket is the same teamfighting style clashing. both these teams conquered semifinals through teamfighting, with WBG having a bit more reasoning to their fights and BLG ooga booga Cinema engaging every fight they can see. the fighting was so intense that doran and peanut were clearly out of it, not being able to match the teamfighting of the 8 other players.\n\nWBG likely can't match the individual skill checks from BLG, and the only way that they could find a way to win would be from BP.\n\ntheir red side opening both yone and aurora was very eye opening, but having used it this many times, BLG's coaching staff would be incompetent not to prepare, and if they really wanted to counter, they could just last ban aurora.\n\nKnight and bin's individual skill means that BLG don't really have to care about bans for them; giving knight aurora doesn't have as much mechanical room as sylas or ahri; banning it so both sides cant play it is good enough.\n\nexcept for this, there is really not much that Daeny can cook on.\n\nBLG won three games on rakan, and while some may think that rakan changes on from a inting off to being turned on, but crisp is also a rakan merchant, winning 2 games of rakan out of their 3\n\nso BP around rakan will also be important, but BLG will certainly have more room in draft than WBG, with knight's sylas and bin's gnar all being points that WBG need to address\n\non WBG side, except for light's ashe, there is no other champs that WBG can certainly dominate the game on; BLG only need to sort out aurora and yone prios and they will have an easy draft\n\nboth teamfighting teams, with WBG more focused on playing the anti-engage and BLG charging in, which is not fundamentally different. BLG's players look better, with more individual skill and more sharp laning, so BLG will probably win this 3:0 or 3:1.""}"

For all the ""bravado"" about Russia‚Äôs strength, the real story behind the scenes is downright bleak. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how deep this economic quicksand goes:\n\n1. **National Wealth Fund is Drying Up Fast:** The liquid assets in Russia‚Äôs National Wealth Fund (–§–ù–ë) are down to a measly $56.7 billion. For context, the projected budget deficit for this year alone is around $30 billion. Where will this cash come from? Yep, you guessed it ‚Äî the same dwindling National Wealth Fund.

Given the sanctions and falling global reliance on Russian energy, this strategy sounds like a wishful fairytale. So, if the budget relies on these non-existent revenues, the Fund likely won‚Äôt see any substantial replenishment anytime soon.\n3. **Running on Empty in Infrastructure and Military:** By January 1, 2024, average Russians will wake up to a triple-whammy:\n   * A *raging hangover* (maybe a metaphor for what‚Äôs happening to their economy?),\n   * An infrastructure on the brink ‚Äî housing, utilities, and public services are practically begging for repairs with no one available to handle them.\n   * And finally, a military that‚Äôs scraping the barrel ‚Äî think tanks and armored vehicles from the mid-20th century. Inflation is also galloping along, making daily life even more of a struggle.\n4. **North Korean Army ‚Äî Not the Cavalry You‚Äôre Waiting For:** There‚Äôs been some noise about a potential influx of North Korean troops. But for Kim Jong-un, deploying soldiers abroad is almost as risky as it sounds. Why? Well, once exposed to the outside world, those soldiers might realize there‚Äôs better living just about anywhere else‚Äîeven in war-torn Donbas. So, Kim‚Äôs not likely to send a meaningful number, if any, to the front lines.\n\n**So, where does this leave us?** In short: Russia\'s economic backbone is shattered. The *National Wealth Fund* is drying up faster than expected, with phantom revenues to ""save the day"" proving to be nothing more than smoke and mirrors. Infrastructure is falling apart, the military\'s gear is ancient, and inflation is rampaging unchecked. Even the mythical ""North Korean army"" support is just that ‚Äî a myth. The fa√ßade of stability is crumbling, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before reality catches up.\n\n[Credit: Midjourney](https://preview.redd.it/lpga2wo51xwd1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed15f3973d19eb14126f9fd3853f40a246a73771)'}"

It‚Äôs a mix of psychology, esotericism, and what some might call fringe ideas. But for those willing to suspend disbelief and explore the boundaries of consciousness, culture, and the unexplained, it may offer fresh perspectives or, at the very least, some provocative ideas to entertain. I\'d love to hear people\'s thoughts!*\n\n**Jung and the Mandala of UFOs**  \nJung saw UFOs as more than mere phenomena; they were symbolic manifestations from the collective unconscious, appearing as *mandalas,* circular symbols representing wholeness, unity, and the Self. For Jung, these symbols had psychological depth and significance, serving as counters to the dominant, rational consciousness of the West. The UFOs took on a lunar, feminine quality, counteracting the solar, masculine Judeo-Christian God that had dominated Western thought. Their sudden prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, according to Jung, reflected a collective need to restore psychic balance in an era when the rational, patriarchal mindset was beginning to feel its limits.\n\n**The Late 19th Century and Cultural Shifts**  \nThe cultural landscape of the late 19th century was marked by rapid industrialisation, scientific progress, and a new materialistic worldview. As machines transformed daily life and science expanded the boundaries of human knowledge, traditional religious beliefs faced unprecedented skepticism. With the first reported UFO sighting in 1896, just before the Wright brothers‚Äô breakthrough in flight, one might wonder if the idea of flight was emerging from humanity‚Äôs collective unconscious, anticipating the technological reality that would soon unfold. The era also witnessed the rise of esotericism, interest in the supernatural, and the beginnings of science fiction, as the world sought both material progress and a reconnection to the mystical and unseen.\n\n**The Occult and Esoteric Revival**  \nIn this period of spiritual questioning, Aleister Crowley, a British occultist and confirmed MI6 agent, claimed to encounter a being called Aiwass in 1904. During this experience in Cairo, Aiwass supposedly dictated *The Book of the Law* to Crowley, revealing Thelema, a new spiritual path. Described as having features resembling a modern ‚Äúgrey alien,‚Äù Aiwass represented a link to realms beyond ordinary perception.\n\nCrowley‚Äôs influence extended to Jack Parsons, co-founder of what would become NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Parsons, captivated by Crowley‚Äôs teachings, joined with L. Ron Hubbard in the 1946 ‚ÄúBabalon Working,‚Äù a ritual aimed at invoking the divine feminine. Hubbard later referenced a spiritual muse he called ‚ÄúEmpress Hathor‚Äù in his personal writings, crediting her as inspiration for his work. Decades later, experiencer Chris Bledsoe also reported encountering Hathor during a profound healing and spiritual transformation, describing her as a guiding figure. These accounts reveal a continuity, suggesting the presence of an archetypal figure like Hathor across both esoteric and UFO-related experiences, bridging mystical exploration with the phenomenon of modern spiritual encounters.\n\nFurther, I personally know members of the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), where they have acknowledged a relationship between consciousness and what some interpret as extraterrestrial or supernatural phenomena. Figures like Kenneth Grant delved deeply into concepts such as non-local properties, telepathy, and psychic abilities, viewing these as bridges between the human psyche and external reality. This exploration has extended into an interest in UFOs, with many in these circles believing that consciousness itself can influence the manifestation of phenomena, including UFO sightings and crop circles, through focused intention and collective belief.\n\nThis concept is linked to principles from quantum mechanics, particularly the notion of *non-locality*, where particles are connected across vast distances in ways that seem instantaneous and unmediated. In esoteric thought, consciousness is theorised to function similarly to quantum particles, with the mind exerting influence beyond the physical body through non-local interactions. These ideas suggest that the mind could potentially interact with or even manifest external phenomena in ways science has yet to fully understand.\n\n**Egregores, The Philip Experiment, and the Power of Belief**  \nThe concept of egregores, collective thought forms created through shared belief, highlights how collective consciousness can manifest phenomena. This idea finds support in the Philip Experiment of the 1970s, where Canadian researchers aimed to create a ‚Äúghost‚Äù named Philip through group intention and visualisation. Over time, the group reported poltergeist-like phenomena attributed to this fictional spirit, demonstrating how focused belief can generate seemingly tangible effects, much like the ideomotor effect, where unconscious movements create autonomous actions.\n\nThis phenomenon resembles the Tibetan concept of *tulpas*, entities thought to be created through intense mental focus and intention. Similar to egregores, tulpas are believed to take on a life of their own, fueled by the creator‚Äôs and sometimes a group‚Äôs collective belief. Together, these concepts suggest that some UFO and paranormal encounters may not stem from external entities but rather from the collective psyche‚Äôs power to manifest internal content as external experiences.\n\n**Manipulating Fear: UFOs, Archetypes, and Psychological Control**  \nJames Hillman, the depth psychologist, saw archetypes as cultural phenomena, and UFOs have unquestionably assumed this role. The 1947 Roswell incident captured the public‚Äôs imagination, embedding UFOs in science fiction, Hollywood films, and popular culture. These portrayals blend extraterrestrial themes with human psychology, making UFOs both literal and symbolic representations of our fascination, and fear of the unknown.\n\nThere is considerable speculation that intelligence agencies, including the CIA, have used UFO narratives as psychological tools for social influence and control. For example, rumours persist that intelligence operations have utilized ‚Äúlimited hangouts,‚Äù or selective releases of ambiguous information, to cement UFOs as a societal mystery. By deliberately fueling public belief in extraterrestrial threats or sightings, these agencies could potentially keep certain areas of public interest occupied, maintaining an atmosphere of uncertainty or even promoting fear when beneficial.\n\nThis approach may serve multiple agendas, from diverting attention away from classified military projects to gauging public response to perceived threats. Some theorise that by positioning UFOs as a potential threat, intelligence agencies create psychological leverage over public perception, encouraging the acceptance of surveillance, defense initiatives, or increased government authority. By feeding into the archetype of the ‚Äúalien other,‚Äù these tactics exploit mankind‚Äôs primal fears and fascination with the unknown, subtly reinforcing reliance on authority for protection against such enigmatic forces.\n\n**The Encounter: Sleep Paralysis, Psychedelics, and Visions of the Alien**  \nWhy do people in sleep paralysis often see grey aliens today, while centuries ago, these beings were considered demons? Experiences of sleep paralysis, near-death experiences (NDEs), out-of-body experiences (OBEs), and the use of psychedelics like DMT all seem to evoke encounters with aliens. DMT users, for instance, often report contact with ‚Äúmechanical elves‚Äù or grey aliens. These experiences raise questions: are these encounters with external entities, or are they projections of the unconscious mind? Are they just influenced by cultural phenomenon or?\n\n**Ancient Aliens and the Lens of Memory Reconsolidation**  \nThe ancient aliens hypothesis suggests that extraterrestrials visited Earth in ancient times, influencing human civilisation. This theory often cites texts describing gods, flying chariots, or mysterious crafts, such as the *vimanas* in ancient Indian epics or the ‚Äúchariots of fire‚Äù in the Bible, which resemble modern UFO descriptions. Memory reconsolidation and confirmation bias play significant roles in interpreting these accounts. Memory reconsolidation is the process by which old memories are reactivated and subtly altered, especially when viewed through contemporary beliefs or cultural lenses. Confirmation bias then reinforces these interpretations; people seeking evidence of ancient aliens tend to interpret these ambiguous texts as proof of early extraterrestrial encounters, reinterpreting ancient mythologies to fit modern narratives.\n\n**Alien Types and Their Symbolic Meanings**\n\nDescriptions of aliens often fall into a few key types, each with its own symbolic resonance:\n\n1. **Greys**: The most common alien type, Greys are typically depicted as short, thin beings with large heads and black, almond-shaped eyes. Some theorise their appearance triggers early childhood memories, resembling a baby‚Äôs perspective of adults. Greys may represent intellectual curiosity and emotional detachment, embodying both human advancement and the anxieties associated with our technological age.\n2. **Mantis Beings**: Often described as tall, insectoid beings, mantis aliens symbolise an almost shamanistic, spiritual presence. These beings are sometimes viewed as healers or higher-order guides, representing a transcendent, otherworldly wisdom beyond human comprehension.\n3. **Reptilians**: Reptilian beings are commonly portrayed as malevolent, symbolising fear, power, and hidden dominance. The imagery of reptiles evokes primal fears and often taps into archetypal themes of control, survival, and raw instinct, embodying humanity‚Äôs struggles with power and hidden agendas.\n4. **Humanoids**: These beings are often described as human-like but more advanced or idealised, sometimes associated with a peaceful and enlightened civilization, such as the Pleiadians. They symbolise familiarity and connection, suggesting kinship or shared ancestry between humans and other species. This evokes ideas of intergalactic unity and kinship, embodying our aspirations for harmony, wisdom, and a higher state of existence.\n\n**Alien Encounters as Spiritual Transformations**  \nMany people who encounter aliens report undergoing profound spiritual transformations, often describing a healing journey. These experiences are usually life-altering, prompting shifts in perception and worldview. Often, individuals adopt more spiritual beliefs, feeling they‚Äôve been guided or healed by these beings. Intriguingly, the messages aliens purportedly deliver during these encounters are frequently prosaic, offering guidance about personal well-being, environmental stewardship, or humanity\'s need for peace. These messages, often mundane in content, resemble the wisdom one might receive from their own subconscious, as though the encounter is a mirror to the individual‚Äôs internal needs and desires.\n\nSuch transformations suggest that alien encounters might act as catalysts for self-reflection, akin to religious or mystical experiences, and open individuals to new ways of seeing themselves and their purpose. This parallels shamanic rites of passage or therapeutic breakthroughs, where deep layers of the psyche are accessed, often resulting in significant healing as individuals confront and integrate hidden aspects of themselves.\n\n**The Intersection of Trauma, Psychology, and the Unconscious in Alien Encounter Experiences**\n\nResearch indicates a strong correlation between reports of UFO phenomena or alien encounters and individuals with a predisposition toward trauma or psychosis. Those who have experienced significant trauma, especially in early life, or who are prone to dissociation or heightened suggestibility, may be more inclined to report these encounters. Harvard psychiatrist Dr. John E. Mack conducted extensive research on alien abduction phenomena and observed that many of his patients had histories of trauma or a tendency toward altered states of consciousness. Mack proposed that these experiences, rather than being purely external or psychotic, might represent a convergence of psychological processes with deeply embedded archetypes and opportunities for personal transformation. He acknowledged that these experiences were psychologically real for his patients, challenging strictly clinical explanations. Mack suggested that such phenomena might exist in a liminal space, where internal fears and desires intersect with powerful symbols from the collective unconscious, creating encounters that feel as real as they are psychologically meaningful.\n\n**Implants and Physical Manifestations**  \nSome abductees report finding small implants or foreign objects placed in their bodies during encounters, with others claiming to have had these objects surgically removed. These implants are often described as metallic, with unusual magnetic or conductive properties, yet scientific explanations remain elusive. One theory suggests these implants may be psychosomatic, serving as symbolic ""marks"" that represent a lingering connection to the encounter. In this view, the mind externalises the intense experience by creating a physical sensation or even minor tissue abnormalities, which the experiencer interprets as an implant, solidifying the encounter‚Äôs perceived reality and reinforcing its impact.'}"

This project leveraged various psychological influence techniques to undermine Fidel Castro‚Äôs government, including propaganda, economic sabotage, and even psychological operations targeting the Cuban populace. As part of Operation Mongoose, U.S. intelligence reportedly planned to use a vision of the Virgin Mary, a sacred figure in Cuban Catholicism, as a tool for psychological manipulation. This ‚Äúmiraculous‚Äù apparition was intended to incite anti-communist sentiment by manipulating cultural beliefs and harnessing religious fervor against the Cuban government. While not directly involving extraterrestrials, this instance reveals a precedent for using deeply ingrained symbols to influence collective perception and achieve political objectives.\n\nIn a similar way, intelligence agencies might exploit UFOs, drawing on their symbolic resonance to generate unease, redirect attention, or manipulate belief. By tapping into the archetype of the ‚Äúalien other,‚Äù these agencies would be utilizing a tool that resonates on a primal level, stirring curiosity, fear, and a collective need for protection. The potential to employ advanced technology, or strategically release information about UFO phenomena, could allow agencies to reinforce societal dependence on established authorities. Just as the Virgin Mary incident sought to sway the Cuban people by invoking a symbol of faith, UFOs could serve as a psychological lever, fostering an atmosphere of uncertainty and reinforcing control through the invocation of mysterious, seemingly uncontrollable forces.\n\n>Peebles, C.

Abrar and Zahid can‚Äôt replicate this performance and we will go back to losing. In 2024, Abdullah has made like 250 runs in 5 matches? Remove the hundred, 150 runs in 9 innings? Saim has made 282 runs in 5 matches, Captain amazing has 191 in 10 innings if you remove the 151.\n\nDropping Babar and Shaheen have fixed nothing. We need 3 new batsmen in the top 3. Aamer Jamal have also been overrated, seems like a mehh all rounder at best. We need a 3rd and 4th spinner if we want to continue making spinning tracks, and we need 2 new pacers with Naseem to go to South Africa. \n\nNot to be a wet blanket, extremely happy that we‚Äôre on the verge of a series victory after 3 years, but lets not forget that we‚Äôre still a broken team and winning a single series doesn‚Äôt change anything.

When the branch was closed, the employee left without returning the assets or completing the handover. Complicating things, the vehicle‚Äôs ownership wasn‚Äôt transferred to the company‚Äôs name from the previous title holder.\n\nAttempts to Recover: Initial efforts were made to contact the employee and retrieve the assets, but with limited success. When the company tried to file an FIR locally, the police declined to proceed, stating that they would not register the complaint.\n\nQuestion: Given this background, what steps can the company now take to legally address the missing assets and overcome the police‚Äôs refusal to file an FIR? Is there an appeals process, or could moving this to a different authority be effective?\n\nNote: Home location of company is Kerala and incidental happened in Chennai.'}"
