Reddit,AAPL,"{'title': 'Stuck on EB|LOG:EXITBS:START, on i5 Ice Lake', 'content': 'I followed Dortania\'s OpenCore install for IceLake, however stuck at EB|LOG:EXITBS:START, even after  following its troubleshooting suggestion.\n\nIt stuck after: `OCSMC: SmcReadValue Key 4D535463 Size 1` and `OCSMC: SmcReadValue Key 4D534163 Size 2`, which many on the web suggest due to iGPU issue.\n\nHope to get more feedback on this, whether another debugging suggestion or simply a working EFI :)\n\nThank you.\n\nPlanned OSX install: `Sonoma 14.7.` USB boot drive made on Mac.\n\nMiniPC Spec (a NUC\'s clone

Reddit,AAPL,"{'title': '[YOLO Update] (No Longer) Going All In On Steel (+🏴\u200d☠️) Update #71. Playing Event Forecast Contracts.', 'content': '# General Update\n\nSince the [last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1fsaa3w/yolo_update_no_longer_going_all_in_on_steel/), my trading of /MES futures using [EfficientEnzyme\'s](https://x.com/efficientenzyme) levels and occasional attempts at puts  have been net positive. I\'ll go over some more recent trades along with my current stock positioning thoughts later in this update. As I\'ve reached a level of being about 1/3 of my cash deployed and much has changed since the last update, I figured I\'d write one up this weekend.\n\nFor the usual disclaimer up front,\xa0**the following is not financial advice and I could be wrong about anything in this post.**\xa0This is just my thought process for how I am playing my personal investment portfolio.\n\n# Macro Thoughts\n\nThe [last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1fsaa3w/yolo_update_no_longer_going_all_in_on_steel/) was fairly accurate in the end on the path of the market. We got a dip that was minor (far more minor than I ever expected) and then continued upward. Economic data remains strong and market participants don\'t mind the new stretched valuations. There is a spot gamma video recently \\[[timestamped link](https://www.youtube.com/live/qXY5kIVhoBQ?si=HbJa9YjWLW6nruk2&t=1185)\\] that points out that the volatility market has started to price in an end of the year rally now.\n\nAs mentioned last time, as expectations for earnings have come down, stock prices have remain elevated. This goes beyond just my example of $AAPL from that previous update. As Wasteland Capital points out \\[[here](https://x.com/ecommerceshares/status/1845941837447532773)\\], earnings revisions have been the most negative since December 2022. This sets up easier ""expectation beats"" despite stocks generally being at ATH levels still. Can there still be negative earnings reactions? Sure. But as a stock price reacts positively most of the time on an expectations beat, the setup just isn\'t great for earnings to cause a market reversal. Investors are just willing to pay more for the same future earnings that will now be ""beats"".\n\nIn other macro updates:\n\n* u/vazdooh posted their market update video \\[[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRwVNtUBL9U)\\] and mentions the puts he had bought ([twitter link](https://x.com/vazdooh/status/1846961309318857066)). But they state they are no longer bearish and plan to exit the puts on any small pullback. He has joined the ""market will just go up"" side.\n* There is a YouTube channel called ""Internet of Bugs"" that I watch which has been evaluating LLM models for Software Engineering. Up until his most recent video, these models wouldn\'t generate great results and he has been a skeptic of their usefulness. ChatGPT-O1 seems to have changed his mind on the potential of LLM models for low level coding though. This \\[[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0yKLumIbaM)\\] is where he tries that model and concludes it is roughly as good as a new graduate with 0-3 months of experience. Just an interesting watch as while the market expectations for generative AI remain elevated beyond what I think generative AI can achieve, there is some progress being made on their usefulness.\n\n# Current Stock Positions\n\nWith the market determined to normalize higher valuations, I mentioned last time that I wasn\'t going to chase. Thus my current plan has been to switch to slowly accumulating positions of individual stocks that are fundamentally still fairly valued. It beats owning the S&P500 or Nasdaq at current valuations. This process is likely going to take some time and I\'ll evaluate if I want to sell after the ""Santa Rally"". (Note: one possibility is also selling CSPs over just directly owning stocks which I am considering on a few tickers). I\'ll also likely keep some free cash available in case an attractive entry appears to take a ""primary position"" in something. To go over the two current picks:\n\n[Fidelity Individual Account \\(Taxable\\)](https://preview.redd.it/sp5l9ybmvuvd1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=766b99be0edf74bdcc40e3173966c7054bee80ed)\n\n \n\n[Fidelity IRA Account](https://preview.redd.it/ysnbrakovuvd1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b3c85b52d766a6bc7f9c8ca90487fc9c5ec5e40)\n\n**$CI**\n\nWith rumors of a buyout offer on $HUM floating around, I bought that $HUM stock at $267.80 right after market close. A few minutes later, a Bloomberg article would come out that $CI had entered into informal merge talks with them \\[[article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-resumes-merger-discussions-humana-205945449.html)\\]. This caused $HUM to spike upward and $CI to move downward. Given that this was just informal talks and $HUM is expected to struggle with their higher Medicare utilization rate and start rating downgrade for the next few years, I took profit at $283.20. I then bought a smaller amount of $CI as that stock still has a forward P/E of around 10 and I doubt they would overpay for $HUM given the situation $HUM finds itself in. With the entire Medicare Advantage segment struggling, there likely just isn\'t a need to pay a large premium and $CI did walk away last year when $HUM demanded too much for the company.\n\n**$DAC**\n\nI\'ve owned this company that leases ships before and it still has the same pros/cons. Valuation is cheap at 3 P/E (both historical and forward). It pays a 3.8% dividend and has about 1/3 of its share value in cash. The company is less dependent on shipping rates than something like $ZIM. They just tend to be conservative about shareholder returns that keeps the stock from being valued much higher.\n\n# The New Forecast Contract Market\n\nInteractive Brokers (IBKR) recently launched a market for predicting event outcomes that one can view \\[[here](https://forecasttrader.interactivebrokers.com/eventtrader)\\]. They have a page that explains it all \\[[here](https://forecasttrader.interactivebrokers.com/en/learn.php)\\] but the main points are:\n\n* Each contract pays out $1 if on the correct side and $0 if one the side that didn\'t occur.\n* There are no commissions or fees currently.\n* One earns a 4.x% annualized yield on the value of the contract held until that event closes.\n\nWhen it initially appeared, I took a look but didn\'t enable it for my account. Then a whale started to skew the presidential betting markets for trump with a sample article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-things-know-mystery-30-172117294.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-things-know-mystery-30-172117294.html) . While IBKR\'s market didn\'t reach the levels of those based on Crypto, what has been seen as a 50/50 election started to offer better odds than that. I decided the change in betting odds made the risk to reward worth it and now own the following contracts:\n\n[Cost basis of $0.44 a contract that will either pay out $0 or $1. The first batch is \\\\""YES\\\\"" for Kamala to win and the second batch is \\\\""No\\\\"" for Trump to win. Market value of the bet right now: $164,764.74.](https://preview.redd.it/53oe3f6guuvd1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8f9531c48ee1d766dab39aa113d7497e03dc76d)\n\nIs this a large bet? It is. But losing it won\'t wipe me out as I\'m not ""all in"" on the play and won\'t be adding much more to this gamble. This isn\'t much different from doing a merger arbitrage play with options (such as what I had done with Amazon trying to acquire iRobot earlier this year that gave me most of my YTD losses). It just has the best risk/reward setup given the 50/50 view of the election outcome by experts.\n\nBut beyond what the polling indicates for the 50/50 odds, I just also want to believe the odds are better than the polls indicate myself. I don\'t want to delve into politics in this series so I\'ll keep this brief. This isn\'t a bet of ""Democrat vs Republican"". This is specifically a bet against Donald Trump and I wouldn\'t be making it if the Republican party had almost any other candidate. I\'ve deleted my brief reasoning for this as I don\'t want to encourage a political debate here. I respect if you feel the opposite of me here and feel free to inverse my bet. :) After all, this is just my personal trading blog and the reasoning behind the bets I\'m taking.\n\nAnother comment to add here is that the IBKR platform could be a superior way to play some macro events over trying to predict how $SPY or $QQQ might react. (The platform is for more than just betting on political outcomes). Often one might guess something like CPI to come in hot/cold to consensus but the market reacts differently than that print might suggest. Depends on what the betting odds are for that event but I\'ll likely keep my eye on it in the future if the market prices in some crazy macro stuff.\n\nOne thing I\'ve not been able to find is information on the tax treatment for these contracts. I\'d guess it just gets taxed as gambling winnings? My attempts to search for an answer to this haven\'t yielded anything. If anyone happens to stumble upon that piece of information or just happens to know, I\'d appreciate the sharing of that information. :)\n\nOne final additional aside: I did connect my IBKR account to the [After Hour](https://www.afterhour.com/) application u/SIR\\_JACK\\_A\\_LOT created but that hasn\'t been worthwhile since nothing I trade actually shows up there? It doesn\'t seem to support $SPX options, /MES futures contracts, or these new type of event contracts. (This is all in addition to Fidelity still not being supported unless something changed recently). I think the whole verification concept of the platform is neat and I respect what u/SIR\\_JACK\\_A\\_LOT is trying to build. It just never ends up working out for me when I try it. ><\n\n# Current Realized Gains (excluding 401k)\n\n**Fidelity (Taxable)**\n\n* Realized YTD loss of -$417,484.\n   * Gain of $31,209 compared to\xa0[last numbers update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1euddjh/https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1ezrals/yolo_update_no_longer_going_all_in_on_steel//).\n\n[Taken from Fidelity Active Trader Pro.](https://preview.redd.it/n2swes1isuvd1.png?width=262&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3720cfae146a9720ab3059f108d864c5c67a0d3)\n\n**Fidelity (IRA)**\n\n* Realized YTD loss of -$7,707.\n   * Gain of $2,062 compared to\xa0[last numbers update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1euddjh/https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1ezrals/yolo_update_no_longer_going_all_in_on_steel//).\n\n[Taken from Fidelity Active Trader Pro.](https://preview.redd.it/1llfxciksuvd1.png?width=263&format=png&auto=webp&s=130bc2dffead7a34bf613c9835372ece324de524)\n\n**IBKR (New)**\n\n* Unrealized and Realized YTD gain of $31,513.22.\n\n[YTD report that takes the \\\\""YTD Change\\\\"" value minus the \\\\""Net Deposit\\\\"" value.

The market tends to surprise once a consensus on short term direction is reached. Thus my plan to only gradually add smaller positions when I see something that appears worth a buy while I retain a large cash pile. But the stock market isn\'t the only casino in town as additional ways to gamble on the odds continue to be invented. I\'ve taken the position on IBKR\'s new event platform that appears to me to offer a good risk/reward ratio as my primary larger sized YOLO. Even if my IBKR bet fails, I\'ll still be up since 2021 as I\'m not going all-in with my entire account on that gamble.\n\nI was glad to see a [post discussing the steel sector](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1g5semb/clf_is_there_a_thesis_still_alive/) on here a few days ago. I think steel companies are interesting but don\'t feel like adding a position in that sector yet. I still wish there was more good DD on sectors and companies being shared on these boards. ><\n\nOh - and I should mentioned that with economic data coming in strong, longer duration bonds don\'t seem attractive to me right now. Why? Generally longer duration bonds have a ""duration risk premium"" associated with them. That\'s why 30 year bonds still yielded around 1.5% when the Fed Funds rate was 0%. If one believes the Fed will cut to only 3% eventually, then the longer end doesn\'t really drop much due to that duration risk premium likely returning. Selling puts against $TLT can be relatively worthwhile on days it drops so that one either earns that premium or acquires it at a cheaper price. But $TLT above $93 isn\'t an appealing option over being cash given the recent string of strong economic data imo.\n\nThat about does it for this particular update. The next one will likely only be when I\'ve added more to my positions or have new macro views to share. Feel free to comment to correct me if you disagree with anything I\'ve written as I\'m always open to reconsidering my current thinking. As always, these are just my personal opinions on what I\'m doing with my portfolio.

Reddit,AAPL,"{'title': 'Trading Tactics: Wall Street Bets (WSB), Herd Mentality, Float & My Single Greatest Trade', 'content': 'You can\'t be in the markets and not know the now infamous Wall Street Bets subreddit in all its glory. In fact, it even has its own movie: Dumb Money. Being honest, it was a fun watch while on a flight.\n\nThe interesting thing about WSB is that it\'s not a new concept, but one that gained popularity because of the popularity of the Internet, Reddit and herd mentality in equal parts to create something that wasn\'t possible ""back in the day."" In 1998 I was part of a similar group, but without the wide appeal because we didn\'t have Reddit back then. We had a site by the name Silicon Investor, where I would eventually start my own stock thread. Similar to Roaring Kitty, ""Tokyo Joe"" started a thread called ""Society Anonyme"" and it quickly became a popular site for high volatility stock trading, discussion and basically the same thing that WSB is today. In fact, while the last post to that thread occurred in 2008, you can still see the subject and its history here:\n\n[https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=21973](https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=21973)\n\nTokyo Joe would eventually face charges surrounding stock manipulation, etc. It truly is a very similar story to that of WSB. I was a frequent poster on his board and many private conversations with him back in the day before I started seeing the true nature of what was going on.\n\nThe key point here is that herd mentality has always been a part of stock trading and markets. Whether in the short term, or the long term, it\'s a pure supply-demand scenario. The primary difference between then and now is the size of the herd, and it\'s a sizable difference. Add in the ability for electronic, algo-driven, high frequency trading on exchanges and you have the ability to move a lot of shares very quickly, potentially \'manipulating\' a stock. Again, it\'s supply and demand in its purest form.\n\nAll stocks have something you should pay attention to:  Float. This is the number of shares available for public trading. Some stocks may have a float of only a few million (or less) while others like $NVDA, could have in the double digit billions. This is where supply and demand economics plays out.\n\nIf you go to the store to purchase lemons and the store has 1,000 lemons in the bin, buying a few lemons will not impact the price. The store may only sell 300 lemons per day and get 300 lemons in shipment the next day to replace the supply. As long as demand is in balance, we have no issue. If the store raises the price on those lemons, people may stop buying them because they can be purchased more cheaply elsewhere. But what happens if/when the store has ONLY 1,000 lemons and suddenly everyone wants lemons. The store may sell 1,000 lemons in a single day and people line up the next morning hoping the story gets a shipment. They do, but because of supply issues, the store can only get 100. Demand will quickly outstrip supply and the store decides they can now charge double for the lemons because they know they will sell out. Rinse and repeat.\n\nNow, in real life, apply this to the toilet paper crisis following Covid.\n\nThe same concept plays out with stocks, but the ""float"" represents the total number of shares available for trade, period. Unless the company decides to issue more shares (dilution) to raise money, the float is the maximum number of shares available for public consumption/trade. This is why they say if you are buying shares in a stock expecting it to rise, you are purchasing the shares from someone expecting it to not go up, or the seller needs to raise cash. It\'s a barter system.\n\nNow apply this supply/demand construct to a stock with very few shares in the float. If 100,000 /WSB day traders all decide to purchase 100 shares of stock at the same time, that is 10,000,000 shares. If the stock only has 10,000,000 or 20,000,000 shares in the float, demand will far outstrip supply and the price rises because sellers can raise the price knowing there\'s enough demand to fill the trade. Of course, as we all know, at some point this price-to-demand model fails, demand dries up due to price and then the opposite can play out. Demand dries up, those who purchased decide to take profits, increasing supply and the price falls because too many shares are available with too few buyers.\n\nFloat is a very important variable in how stocks move, the volatility. Any stock with a low float can be manipulated and this is one thing the SEC is watching for. Of course, it\'s very difficult to prove manipulation. The higher the float of a stock, the more demand it will take to move the stock. if the /WSB group was more focused, they could be targeting low float stocks on a regular basis, moving in and out of them as a herd. It\'s hard to determine where the manipulation begins and ends. In the end, however, there are always those who caught on late, and end up with losses. The WSB bag holders, those behind the Wendy\'s dumpster or someone other than your wife\'s boyfriend. Insert your own WSB colloquialism here.\n\nThis is how stocks move up, down, go to the moon, crash and burn, etc. etc. taking traders along for the euphoric or painful ride. Obviously, in most situations, stocks trade via normal supply and demand as a result to their business model success, events, earnings, etc. Where /WSB started losing its teeth is when they started deemphasizing Sh!t stocks with low floats and decided to start tracking larger float quality names. The supply/demand model still plays out, but with less volatility due to the size of float in most of these stocks. High float, more demand needed to move the stock, less volatility.\n\n**My Single Best Trade**\n\nI have a long, maybe even storied, history in the markets. From full-on day trader back in the 90s and early 2000\'s to today. Back in mid 2020, I started accumulating a small marijuana stock by the name of Tilray ($TLRY), partly because we were in an election year and the republicans held office, there was continuing interest in marijuana legalization (I have never even tried the stuff), and I was starting to see more and more forum interest on the name, especially on /WSB.\n\nTLRY had a lower float, was gaining in popularity and there were other catalysts that I felt made it a worthwhile swing trade, maybe even a long term hold if legalization efforts broadened, the model worked and TLRY became very profitable.\n\nMaking a long story short, I started a two-phase position by a risk-weighted multiple-thousand share position between $4-$5/share in mid 2020. The stock was percolating but not moving materially for any length of time. After one particular volume spike, followed by a quick rise in price, the stock swelled to $7 but fell quickly back to $5. But what I noticed was the volume, /WSB mention and that price spike. When the stock settled again, volume was back to normal. Deciding to trade around my long shares, I started accumulating $5 leap (long dated) calls. What followed were events that I could not have accurately predicted. The democrats ended up in office, helping all pot stocks. TLRY\'s model was gaining favor as one of the largest producers. But what really took the top off was that /WSB erupted in all things TLRY for about a two week period beginning in Feb. 2021. The rise leading up to the spike was good, taking the stock to $20 and I peeled off some shares and even some of the calls to protect profits, leaving most of the position in place. The the day or two that followed, the stock erupted from $20, to an intraday price of more than $70. Fear and Greed in my own head kicked in and I waited and watched, eventually deciding to pull the trigger on the entire position around $60 as the stock started falling. I exited the entire position between $55-$60.\n\nChart for this time period is below.\n\n[TLRY - 6 mos. Chart](https://preview.redd.it/m38wqe3wgqvd1.png?width=1601&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2fd3997fa22676b05c83ca973be9bb4435236c4)\n\nThe % gain on the position was massive, both in liquidation of the long shares and, especially the Calls. In this case, my prudence still limited the gain to a % of what it could have been because I am never willing to allow a speculative position to occupy too heavy a weight due to risk management. It\'s fun to dream what this trade could have yielded if I was a true WSB degenerate but it was still quite sizable and material to the overall account. For relation, even as a right-sized speculation weight, the gain from this single trade boosted the account value by more than 25%, in a tax-advantaged account.\n\nTLRY is now back to $1.50 per share. It\'s model continues to erode. The fervor is gone but the potential remains simply due to history. TLRY is also a perfect example of one of my Phoenix trades (you can search for that on this sub). At one point in the past, TLRY spiked to $300. That is an important aspect to a phoenix trade.\n\nThis is how speculation can work but, in most cases, it does not. Traders chase profits like these but a vast majority of time it ends in fire and flames, bag holders and loss porn. Sometimes a big gain is the worst thing an individual can have. Those without discipline to understand fear, greed and gambling are lined up for a trip to complete ruin. I never tried to recreate this trade though I still dabble in right-sized speculation ($SOUN) on the potential. Keep positions very low in % and very few in number.\n\nLightning can strike but do yourself a favor and never expect and, if it does strike, don\'t expect it to strike again in the same place.\n\nLearn to look at ""float"" for an opportunity for long term gains. Low float stocks with good business models can split, increasing your shares and leading to incredible profits. You only need one $AAPL, $MSFT, $NVDA, $NFLX, $CSCO, $META, $GOOGL to go to the moon and take your net worth with it. But be smart!'}"
Reddit,AAPL,"{'title': 'Covered Call Expiring Exactly At the Money', 'content': 'I wrote a covered call on AAPL with a 235.00 strike price that expired on Friday. AAPL closed exactly at 235.00 on Friday, and today I got the alert from Vanguard that the option was exercised and my shares were called away. I figured I was in the clear since there is no benefit to exercising an expired option for an underlying exactly at the strike price. Does anyone have any experience with this? Isn\'t this technically exercising a contract that is out of the money, with 235.01 being the start of ""In the money""? Is exercising it something that is automatically done by Vanguard or is there something I am missing that would cause someone to choose to exercise this?'}"
Reddit,AAPL,"{'title': 'Wealth Realization - we are fools trying not to be foolish', 'content': ""Hello r/FatFIRE community! We (63m, 60f) wanted to share a bit about our current financial situation and plans as we continue to navigate the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) journey. Both started with nothing, worked our way through school and had wonderful careers. We have retired a few times over the past twenty years but, after a year or two, went back to work. We finally retired eight years ago.\n\nFinancial Overview:\nNet Worth: $24.7M\n\nAssets:\n\t•\tStock Portfolio: $15.6M, primarily in AAPL (acquired in the early 90s, near-zero cost basis)\n\t•\tEquity in LLC (apartments): $6.1M\n\t•\tReal Estate: $4.5M in assets across two apartment complexes and three homes\n\t•\tOther: $745K\n\nLiabilities:\n\t•\tMortgage on 2nd Home (MCOL): $630K at 3.1% (28-year term)\n\t•\tRental Property Loan: $1.58M at 2.7% (balloon payment due December 2026)\n\t•\tCredit Card Balance (paid monthly): $9K\n\nIncome and Expenses:\nIncome:\n\t•\tDividends and Rentals: $260K/year\nAnnual Expenses:\n\t•\tCity Condo Currently Renting (VHCOL): $50K\n\t•\t1st Home (VHCOL): $12K\n\t•\t2nd Home (MCOL): $48K\n\t•\tTravel: Approximately $24K annually (four months of travel at ~$200/day)\nWe’ve been fortunate to reach this position through a mix of stock investments, real estate, and steady income streams. Our focus now is on optimizing asset allocation, managing taxes, and setting up systems for efficient wealth transfer to our children.\n\nAdvisor Suggestions:\nWe recently had a meeting with our financial advisors, and we’d love to get the community's opinions on some options they presented:\n\nStructured Ownership Program (SOP):\n\t•\tThis strategy involves a Series LLC that generates profits through activities like factoring and foreign exchange trading. The key benefit is receiving a large K1 loss (up to 8x ordinary income or 10x capital gains) relative to your capital contribution. This could potentially defer taxes for long periods, with the loan renewable every 15 years without triggering taxable gains, as long as you don't exit early.\n\t•\tExample: A $300K capital contribution generates a $2.7M loan (9x), creating a $3M tax basis to offset $3M in capital gains.\n\t•\tCost: 3.5% of the K1 value upfront, plus an additional 4% fee to cover taxes on the gains in the first year. For a $3M capital gain, this would total $225K.\n\t•\tNet Cash Benefit: $450K saved compared to paying $855K in taxes without the strategy.\n\t•\tNote: This strategy defers both federal and state taxes.\n\tQuestion: Has anyone here used a similar program? How did it work out in terms of long-term benefits and risks?\n\nTax Credits (Sovereign Tribal Federal Tax Credits):\nInvest in infrastructure improvements to Native Americans, to help them build water treatments, schools, roads, etc. this gives them money for big projects and in return you get tax credits to help lower federal taxes. They were granted tax credits for exactly this purpose. \n\t•\tThese credits are available for 60 cents on the dollar, with a minimum investment of $60,000.\n\t•\tThey offset federal tax liability dollar-for-dollar, with the ability to carry forward unused credits for up to five years.\n\t•\tNote: This does not affect state taxes.\n\t\nQuestion: Have you used tax credits to offset liabilities? Do you think these credits provide significant value relative to their cost?\n\t\nLeverage Charitable Donation:\n\t•\tThis option eliminates taxes through charitable donations, with fewer future concerns than the SOP but potentially slightly lower savings.\n\tQuestion: What are your thoughts on structured donations for tax savings vs. something like SOP?\n\t\nAsset Protection and Estate Planning:\n\t•\tWe are in the process of setting up trusts to protect assets and manage estate taxes.\n\tQuestion: What strategies have you used to stay below estate tax limits and protect assets effectively?\n\t\nInvestment Strategy:\n\t•\tWe’re discussing selling and diversifying up to half of our AAPL stock to balance growth potential with risk management.\n\tQuestion: How do you manage the diversification of large, single-stock positions while maintaining strong growth prospects?\n\nAdditional Thoughts:\n\t•\tLong-term Wealth Management Considerations:\n\t•\tShift from growth to preservation mindset\n\t•\tDiversification away from concentrated position\n\t•\tEstate planning: trusts, staying below estate tax limits\n\t•\tPotential future gifts to children (e.g., paying off mortgages)\n\t•\tPersonal Reflections:\n\t•\tStruggle to shift from frugal mindset to higher spending\n\t•\tDesire for experiences (e.g., family trips) vs. continued wealth accumulation\n\t•\tBalancing prudent financial management with enjoying wealth\n\t•\tOur AGI for the past five years has been around $55K.\n\t•\tWe also gift the maximum stock to our four successful adult children annually.\n\t•\tWe’re considering a 2025 stock liquidation amount between $500K and $3M, might even sell up to $8M.\n\nThanks for taking a moment to read. Would love to hear your ideas and experiences. \n\n""}"

Reddit,MSFT,"{'title': '40M @ $3.4M NW…Finally Free 🔥', 'content': '**ME**. 40M, single, never married with adult kid. Lived in Europe and in America as a child. Moved around the US often as an adult. Started life in middle class, always had the basics like shelter, food, healthcare, although both parents came from slightly above poverty households. Family not particularly close, after 16 it felt like I was emancipated and have been on my own ever since. My life goals at 18 were to have a car, apartment and make $35K/yr which was enough for the “good life” in the LCOL area. Relationship wise I want a life partner but have zero desire for children.\n\n**CAREER**. Tech exec with $980K annual comp. Multiple STEM degrees, technical certifications, business degree and certifications. First half of my career was in a “*boring industry*”, switched to tech and never looked back. Stayed around emerging (new) technologies as I knew with limited experience I could get paid top dollar.\n\n**RELATIONSHIP WITH MONEY**. It’s toxic AF ☺️…seriously, through listening, research and therapy I realized I equate money to safety. Most of my life I’ve had zero support and needed to save money to take care of myself and child or else I felt I’d be out on the street homeless. The environment I came from felt unsafe (e.g. held at gunpoint as a teenager) so the idea of no money, on the streets homeless and a lack of ability to keep myself safe was frightening and not something I would let happen. This emotional state stayed with me through making hundreds of thousands of dollars resulting in comparatively small spending vs my pay as I needed to save it all or else I’d be homeless or destitute, even when making hundreds of thousands with less than $100K in annual expenses.\n\n**FIRE INTRODUCTION**. I originally hated FIRE as everyone thought I jumped on a FIRE bandwagon although I’ve been planning for early retirement since 17. I watched a few FIRE people on YouTube, which made me want to further stay away from the group as they seem like sleezeballs and not knowledgeable. Eventually I got exposed to the right communities and found people in similar situations to me, with more knowledge than me across various topics (e.g. taxes) and felt the portion of the FIRE community I engaged with is an asset and accelerated my growth. I can’t overstate how important it was to have others in a similar situation as me that I could ask questions to for navigating a unique, somewhat taboo situation. The reason I’m sharing in the event it helps someone else.\n\n**DECISION TO RETIRE**. I made a plan at 17 to retire early at 45 as I rationalized “everyone hates their jobs, might as well save up a lot of money and escape that hell sooner than later.” I realize now the negative viewpoint was driven by the adults in my life that I saw not enjoying work. This viewpoint also stayed with me throughout my career, probably allowing me to suffer and deal with more shit because I expected work to be bad. More bad stuff I deAlt with (vs just complaining) the higher I rose. This thought process broke for me when I was making $1M/yr at $1T company. There were three people between me and the CEO and I did not envy or want any of their jobs. I saw people lose their family members and could only take off one day to mourn over a three-day weekend because they were a busy, important executive and couldn’t step away. Another guy literally had a broken back and was in meetings slouched over a chair versus recovering. One person looked like at any given moment, they would have a stroke and die. Their eyes were always twitching and they had pretty bad health. I asked myself, if they are making way more than $1M a year and have a high net worth but can’t prioritize their health or family any more than someone working a low-level factory job, what is the use? At the same time I found all the sacrifices I made to get to the top were now extremely difficult if not impossible. Once I had FI, for lack of better words, I gave no fucks. I actually loved to work and shaping industries for emerging technologies but hated the political nature which was the primary part of my role as an exec, not the technology. Work became no fun and not necessary so I decided to retire, although it took a lot of emotional turmoil to get to the point of pulling the trigger. Almost as soon as I decided I no longer need to work for money, my dream company came along and offered me a job at $2M/year. I LoL’d, thought the universe was really trying to test my resolve and declined the role.\n\n**FIRE TARGET**. This was a continually moving goal, and not for practical reasons. As mentioned, money is security for me so the more neurotic I got the larger the FIRE number I needed to feel secure. It didn’t help to have many coworkers that were multimillionaires telling me anything under $5M net worth is the equivalent of being in poverty and I shouldn’t stop until at least $15M. Ironically, these people were at or past those numbers and still mostly unhappy. Also my 90% safe SWR is 4.84% (not 4%) and my bulletproof SWR is 4.04% (not 3.25%). My original FIRE target was $10K/mo or $2.5M. That number changed at some point to $5M but then got back to where I settled which was $2.7M. At $2.7M or $11K/mo I was no longer trading off time for money.\n\n**RETIREMENT BUDGET**. Before retiring my spend was roughly $7K/mo or $84K/year. In a MCOL city I stayed in a luxury high-rise ($2,700), drove a luxury vehicle ($1,100), had a healthy food budget ($1,750), got regular massages ($400) and had disposable income ($1,000+) left over. That is in addition to investing the majority of my income. My retirement budget differs in the fact that I will no longer be living in the US, which winds up being cheaper (e.g. health insurance) for a better quality of life. Of the places I’ve looked at, either $5K/mo (e.g. SE Asia, LATAM) or $8K/mo (e.g. Europe, Middle East) was enough to live an upper class life (#ChubbyFire). Actual expenses below for two MCOL cities, one in the US (as backup) and my international destination.\n\n**Budget A (International |**  $6,700 Total**)**\n\n* Rent: $3,500\n* Transportation: $400 (private driver, Lexus)\n* Food: $1,500\n* Insurance: $400\n* Gym: $200\n* Massage: $400\n* Misc: $300\n\n**Budget B (US |** $8,800 Total**)**\n\n* $1,500 BMW i4\n* $1,750 Food\n* $3,750 Luxury High-rise premier zipcode\n* $850 Insurance\n* $300 Misc bills, subscriptions\n* $400 Massages\n* $250 Gym\n\n**PORTFOLIO**. Breakout of $3.4M NW.\n\n* **HYSA**: $651K - all from a recent influx of cash. To protect both of us it’s better I don’t disclose how and you don’t ask 😉. Will most likely invest $500K of this, but still determining where. Currently sits in Vanguard Federal (VMFXX).\n* **Bank**: $8K - random transactional cash. Try to keep this at $20K or less.\n* **Crypto**: $235K - started at $70K, got up to $450K. Will sell next time it hits $400K+\n* **Investment (post-tax)**: $2,415K - Includes VTSAX, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, KO, AMD, QCOM. Most of the money is in VTSAX, periodically I got hundred thousand dollar bonuses and go into an individual stock if I saw they were significantly undervalued and I knew enough about the industry to make a relevant call on the stock’s value (e.g. picking tech vs healthcare companies).\n* **Investment (pre-tax)**: $100K - 401(k). Used sparingly as I knew I didn’t want money tied in an account I didn’t have access to until late 60s which also incurs early withdrawal tax penalties. 100% of the retirement is a VTSAX equivalent.\xa0\n\n$3.4M total. 4.84% SWR: $13,713/mo. Left Over After Expenses: $7K/mo\xa0 (internationally) and $5K/mo (US).\n\n**SWR PHILOSOPHY**: As mentioned, my relationship with money was driven by fear/insecurity/generally bad stuff. This impacted my SWR by making me pick the lowest possible percentage that was “guaranteed” to be safe. As I’ve matured closer to retirement, I realize there is no guarantees. I also believe that retiring is not a one-way door, meaning I am retiring from trading my time for money but can return whenever I’d like (albeit for less pay). I also don’t think FIRE equates to not generating money ever again in life. I believe it almost impossible to not generate money ever again as I’m entrepreneurial minded. I’ll now just be doing things for myself and out of enjoyment versus to monetize. I also have the luxury of only needing a SWR of 2.4% to cover all my expenses. Each month I will try to “spend up to” the 4.84% which admittedly will be a struggle but I’m committed to it post reading Die With Zero. The “spend up to” SWR philosophy helps in at least two ways. **1**) If my portfolio gets cut in half and spending gets cut in half, my core lifestyle doesn’t change. I’ve always lived on a fraction of my income so living below my means is easy, living at my means is the hard part. **2**) The ability to significantly cut expenses each month is one of the better safety mechanisms in retirement. There are calculators online that allow you to put in monthly spend fluctuation. The bigger the adjustment you’re able to make, you can either withdraw more money or have a higher probability of success with the same amount of money. I don’t want more money, as I’m struggling to spend what I have but I do want the increased probability of staying successfully retired.\n\n**DEBT**. I have none. No car payment, house payment, student loans, credit card bills, etc.\n\n**TAXES**. I don’t normally factor these in. I expect to take around $120K/yr which I get a standard deduction of $20K and the first $40K/year in capital gains are tax free. As example, taking out $120K, $90K of it is taxable ($30K is the OG investment) and I’d pay 15% or $4.5K ($90K minus $60K tax exempt portion) or $375/mo in taxes. The low effective tax doesn’t change much if I go from $120K to a $165K withdrawal, and as I live well below my top monthly SWR taxes at these levels are negligible.\n\n**ADVICE (recommendations).** Primary advice I’d give below…\n\n1. **Prioritize Health & Relationships**. It’s the most important thing. You can have money but not your health and probably aren’t going to enjoy life. To get to a multimillionaire status before the age of 40 you will probably have to prioritize work/wealth generation over a lot of things, but I don’t recommend consistently prioritizing work over your health and family/relationships. Both can make you spiritually rich and help you become financially rich.\n2. \xa0**Find Internal Validation**. One of the hardest parts about retiring is losing the validation I got through work. Making $1 million a year, having a nice title, getting access to things others didn’t as I was an executive, etc. all went to my head. Not immediately, not even noticeably but eventually. If most or all of your validation comes from the company you’re at, the work you do and the money you’re getting paid then retiring will be very difficult, regardless of how much money you have. I’ve seen many people post, “*I’m 60, have $XM NW and my health is failing me, I hate my job but don’t know what else to do. I have no friends, personal life, hobbies so I just stay working…*” I’ve never been in this state but do feel for these people. You can avoid the negative state by being able to self validate, which is important for something like FIRE. You are in a unique situation, you’re doing things the average person will never do so you’re not going to get validation from the masses. If anything you’re going to get told the opposite: “don’t do it, you’re foolish, it’ll never work, why are you wasting your time?” If you can make a decision, do the research and draw a logical conclusion and stick to that you will have a better FIRE experience. Same is true with the need for Reddit validation (e.g. “I read your plan, love it! I’m rooting for you and everyone else does plans like these and they always succeeded, you’ll be fine!”).\n3. **Avoid Financial Neurosis**. Most of western society is focused on overindulgence and mass consumption at the cost of being in debt, slave to corporations, declining mental and physical health, etc. While it was very clear to me spending compulsively is unhealthy, it took a long time to realize my relationship of saving compulsively was unhealthy too. With money I was the equivalent of one of these reality TV show hoarders, well past being an efficient saver because of all of the negative emotions associated with my relationship with money. I see post after post that reads something along the lines of, “*I am unhappy, hate my job, have struggling relationships, my health is failing me and I have $XM NW, can I retire? I’m afraid to…*” That kind of attachment to money/work is unhealthy to me. While I’ve benefited from it, as corporate America rewards and is built on people that think like this, I’ve also suffered from it. I pray others focus on their relationship with money, maintaining a healthy balance and setting appropriate boundaries.\n4. **Use Lifestyle Arbitrage**. As I worked in tech, many friends/associates live in HCOL areas across the West Coast. My $90K/yr MCOL budget was $200K/yr for them for the same lifestyle. For people currently struggling with jobs they hate or who don’t want to have a large FIRE number to support living in a HCOL city, move to a L/MCOL city. For example $1.5M FIRE number ($6K/mo) gives you a good to great life in Lisbon, Mexico City, Bangkok, Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona and many cities across the US. At $2.5M ($10K/mo) I wouldn’t feel comfortable living in a HCOL city like NY or San Francisco where at $100K you can still apply for government assistance as you are considered at the poverty line. If you are unhappy, unhealthy, and can retire earlier and it just requires moving…then move.\xa0\n\n**WHAT’S NEXT**. Another reason I decided to retire was work was getting in the way. I had a lot of hobbies and could not explore them fully. This allowed me to “retire to something” vs “retire from something” which is the difference of running to something you enjoy vs running away from something you hate (former creates better mental health). I enjoy creating which manifest in music and film production, writing short stories and scripts and I’ve written a book. I also like to travel, workout, play sports, attend live sporting events, live music events, plays/theater, watch TV shows, movies, play video games, read, some lounges/parties, etc. I plan to explore these hobbies fully and do things I never got to do (e.g. skiing) while I still have the physical health to do so. In addition to tech, I’ve also worked as a college professor at some top universities. I’m offered up to $1,500 per hour for consulting. Originally, when I planned to retire, I said that I would do both of these things but now I can see I was making the decision from a bad place mentally. I found I need to retire, take some time off of work to just relax and be, then make a decision on what I want to do next. A friend group who retired early from selling a startup told me they had plans on what they would do when they got the money, but it came from their overworked corporate mind which could rationalize spending time consulting or doing some modification of their existing work (not truly stepping away). When they did retire, as example, one guy who was going to consult wound up being a substitute teacher. When I asked him why he said, he never planned on it but realize after FIRE that substitution was one of the few jobs he could have which didn’t require him to work every day and didn’t require him to miss taking his kids to and from school as he works during their school hours. So I too am leaving the space open to allow myself to formulate what I want to do next.\xa0\n\nAnd that’s all I can think of. Hope this helps. 😎✌🏾\n\nLet me know if you have any FIRE related questions to the above content (not interested in giving career advice, diving into personal non-FIRE topics, etc). '}"

As example, taking out $120K, $90K of it is taxable ($30K is the OG investment) and I’d pay 15% or $4.5K ($90K minus $60K tax exempt portion) or $375/mo in taxes. The low effective tax doesn’t change much if I go from $120K to a $165K withdrawal, and as I live well below my top monthly SWR taxes at these levels are negligible.\n\n**ADVICE (recommendations).** Primary advice I’d give below…\n\n1. **Prioritize Health & Relationships**. It’s the most important thing. You can have money but not your health and probably aren’t going to enjoy life. To get to a multimillionaire status before the age of 40 you will probably have to prioritize work/wealth generation over a lot of things, but I don’t recommend consistently prioritizing work over your health and family/relationships. Both can make you spiritually rich and help you become financially rich.\n2. \xa0**Find Internal Validation**. One of the hardest parts about retiring is losing the validation I got through work. Making $1 million a year, having a nice title, getting access to things others didn’t as I was an executive, etc. all went to my head. Not immediately, not even noticeably but eventually. If most or all of your validation comes from the company you’re at, the work you do and the money you’re getting paid then retiring will be very difficult, regardless of how much money you have. I’ve seen many people post, “*I’m 60, have $XM NW and my health is failing me, I hate my job but don’t know what else to do. I have no friends, personal life, hobbies so I just stay working…*” I’ve never been in this state but do feel for these people. You can avoid the negative state by being able to self validate, which is important for something like FIRE. You are in a unique situation, you’re doing things the average person will never do so you’re not going to get validation from the masses. If anything you’re going to get told the opposite: “don’t do it, you’re foolish, it’ll never work, why are you wasting your time?” If you can make a decision, do the research and draw a logical conclusion and stick to that you will have a better FIRE experience. Same is true with the need for Reddit validation (e.g. “I read your plan, love it! I’m rooting for you and everyone else does plans like these and they always succeeded, you’ll be fine!”).\n3. **Avoid Financial Neurosis**. Most of western society is focused on overindulgence and mass consumption at the cost of being in debt, slave to corporations, declining mental and physical health, etc. While it was very clear to me spending compulsively is unhealthy, it took a long time to realize my relationship of saving compulsively was unhealthy too. With money I was the equivalent of one of these reality TV show hoarders, well past being an efficient saver because of all of the negative emotions associated with my relationship with money. I see post after post that reads something along the lines of, “*I am unhappy, hate my job, have struggling relationships, my health is failing me and I have $XM NW, can I retire? I’m afraid to…*” That kind of attachment to money/work is unhealthy to me. While I’ve benefited from it, as corporate America rewards and is built on people that think like this, I’ve also suffered from it. I pray others focus on their relationship with money, maintaining a healthy balance and setting appropriate boundaries.\n4. **Use Lifestyle Arbitrage**. As I worked in tech, many friends/associates live in HCOL areas across the West Coast. My $90K/yr MCOL budget was $200K/yr for them for the same lifestyle. For people currently struggling with jobs they hate or who don’t want to have a large FIRE number to support living in a HCOL city, move to a L/MCOL city. For example $1.5M FIRE number ($6K/mo) gives you a good to great life in Lisbon, Mexico City, Bangkok, Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona and many cities across the US. At $2.5M ($10K/mo) I wouldn’t feel comfortable living in a HCOL city like NY or San Francisco where at $100K you can still apply for government assistance as you are considered at the poverty line. If you are unhappy, unhealthy, and can retire earlier and it just requires moving…then move.\xa0\n\n**WHAT’S NEXT**. Another reason I decided to retire was work was getting in the way. I had a lot of hobbies and could not explore them fully. This allowed me to “retire to something” vs “retire from something” which is the difference of running to something you enjoy vs running away from something you hate (former creates better mental health). I enjoy creating which manifest in music and film production, writing short stories and scripts and I’ve written a book. I also like to travel, workout, play sports, attend live sporting events, live music events, plays/theater, watch TV shows, movies, play video games, read, some lounges/parties, etc. I plan to explore these hobbies fully and do things I never got to do (e.g. skiing) while I still have the physical health to do so. In addition to tech, I’ve also worked as a college professor at some top universities. I’m offered up to $1,500 per hour for consulting. Originally, when I planned to retire, I said that I would do both of these things but now I can see I was making the decision from a bad place mentally. I found I need to retire, take some time off of work to just relax and be, then make a decision on what I want to do next. A friend group who retired early from selling a startup told me they had plans on what they would do when they got the money, but it came from their overworked corporate mind which could rationalize spending time consulting or doing some modification of their existing work (not truly stepping away). When they did retire, as example, one guy who was going to consult wound up being a substitute teacher. When I asked him why he said, he never planned on it but realize after FIRE that substitution was one of the few jobs he could have which didn’t require him to work every day and didn’t require him to miss taking his kids to and from school as he works during their school hours. So I too am leaving the space open to allow myself to formulate what I want to do next.\xa0\n\nAnd that’s all I can think of. Hope this helps. 😎✌🏾\n\nLet me know if you have any FIRE related questions to the above content (not interested in giving career advice, diving into personal non-FIRE topics, etc). '}"

Reddit,MSFT,"{'title': 'Trading Tactics: Wall Street Bets (WSB), Herd Mentality, Float & My Single Greatest Trade', 'content': 'You can\'t be in the markets and not know the now infamous Wall Street Bets subreddit in all its glory. In fact, it even has its own movie: Dumb Money. Being honest, it was a fun watch while on a flight.\n\nThe interesting thing about WSB is that it\'s not a new concept, but one that gained popularity because of the popularity of the Internet, Reddit and herd mentality in equal parts to create something that wasn\'t possible ""back in the day."" In 1998 I was part of a similar group, but without the wide appeal because we didn\'t have Reddit back then. We had a site by the name Silicon Investor, where I would eventually start my own stock thread. Similar to Roaring Kitty, ""Tokyo Joe"" started a thread called ""Society Anonyme"" and it quickly became a popular site for high volatility stock trading, discussion and basically the same thing that WSB is today. In fact, while the last post to that thread occurred in 2008, you can still see the subject and its history here:\n\n[https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=21973](https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=21973)\n\nTokyo Joe would eventually face charges surrounding stock manipulation, etc. It truly is a very similar story to that of WSB. I was a frequent poster on his board and many private conversations with him back in the day before I started seeing the true nature of what was going on.\n\nThe key point here is that herd mentality has always been a part of stock trading and markets. Whether in the short term, or the long term, it\'s a pure supply-demand scenario. The primary difference between then and now is the size of the herd, and it\'s a sizable difference. Add in the ability for electronic, algo-driven, high frequency trading on exchanges and you have the ability to move a lot of shares very quickly, potentially \'manipulating\' a stock. Again, it\'s supply and demand in its purest form.\n\nAll stocks have something you should pay attention to:  Float. This is the number of shares available for public trading. Some stocks may have a float of only a few million (or less) while others like $NVDA, could have in the double digit billions. This is where supply and demand economics plays out.\n\nIf you go to the store to purchase lemons and the store has 1,000 lemons in the bin, buying a few lemons will not impact the price. The store may only sell 300 lemons per day and get 300 lemons in shipment the next day to replace the supply. As long as demand is in balance, we have no issue. If the store raises the price on those lemons, people may stop buying them because they can be purchased more cheaply elsewhere. But what happens if/when the store has ONLY 1,000 lemons and suddenly everyone wants lemons. The store may sell 1,000 lemons in a single day and people line up the next morning hoping the story gets a shipment. They do, but because of supply issues, the store can only get 100. Demand will quickly outstrip supply and the store decides they can now charge double for the lemons because they know they will sell out. Rinse and repeat.\n\nNow, in real life, apply this to the toilet paper crisis following Covid.\n\nThe same concept plays out with stocks, but the ""float"" represents the total number of shares available for trade, period. Unless the company decides to issue more shares (dilution) to raise money, the float is the maximum number of shares available for public consumption/trade. This is why they say if you are buying shares in a stock expecting it to rise, you are purchasing the shares from someone expecting it to not go up, or the seller needs to raise cash. It\'s a barter system.\n\nNow apply this supply/demand construct to a stock with very few shares in the float. If 100,000 /WSB day traders all decide to purchase 100 shares of stock at the same time, that is 10,000,000 shares. If the stock only has 10,000,000 or 20,000,000 shares in the float, demand will far outstrip supply and the price rises because sellers can raise the price knowing there\'s enough demand to fill the trade. Of course, as we all know, at some point this price-to-demand model fails, demand dries up due to price and then the opposite can play out. Demand dries up, those who purchased decide to take profits, increasing supply and the price falls because too many shares are available with too few buyers.\n\nFloat is a very important variable in how stocks move, the volatility. Any stock with a low float can be manipulated and this is one thing the SEC is watching for. Of course, it\'s very difficult to prove manipulation. The higher the float of a stock, the more demand it will take to move the stock. if the /WSB group was more focused, they could be targeting low float stocks on a regular basis, moving in and out of them as a herd. It\'s hard to determine where the manipulation begins and ends. In the end, however, there are always those who caught on late, and end up with losses. The WSB bag holders, those behind the Wendy\'s dumpster or someone other than your wife\'s boyfriend. Insert your own WSB colloquialism here.\n\nThis is how stocks move up, down, go to the moon, crash and burn, etc. etc. taking traders along for the euphoric or painful ride. Obviously, in most situations, stocks trade via normal supply and demand as a result to their business model success, events, earnings, etc. Where /WSB started losing its teeth is when they started deemphasizing Sh!t stocks with low floats and decided to start tracking larger float quality names. The supply/demand model still plays out, but with less volatility due to the size of float in most of these stocks. High float, more demand needed to move the stock, less volatility.\n\n**My Single Best Trade**\n\nI have a long, maybe even storied, history in the markets. From full-on day trader back in the 90s and early 2000\'s to today. Back in mid 2020, I started accumulating a small marijuana stock by the name of Tilray ($TLRY), partly because we were in an election year and the republicans held office, there was continuing interest in marijuana legalization (I have never even tried the stuff), and I was starting to see more and more forum interest on the name, especially on /WSB.\n\nTLRY had a lower float, was gaining in popularity and there were other catalysts that I felt made it a worthwhile swing trade, maybe even a long term hold if legalization efforts broadened, the model worked and TLRY became very profitable.\n\nMaking a long story short, I started a two-phase position by a risk-weighted multiple-thousand share position between $4-$5/share in mid 2020. The stock was percolating but not moving materially for any length of time. After one particular volume spike, followed by a quick rise in price, the stock swelled to $7 but fell quickly back to $5. But what I noticed was the volume, /WSB mention and that price spike. When the stock settled again, volume was back to normal. Deciding to trade around my long shares, I started accumulating $5 leap (long dated) calls. What followed were events that I could not have accurately predicted. The democrats ended up in office, helping all pot stocks. TLRY\'s model was gaining favor as one of the largest producers. But what really took the top off was that /WSB erupted in all things TLRY for about a two week period beginning in Feb. 2021. The rise leading up to the spike was good, taking the stock to $20 and I peeled off some shares and even some of the calls to protect profits, leaving most of the position in place. The the day or two that followed, the stock erupted from $20, to an intraday price of more than $70. Fear and Greed in my own head kicked in and I waited and watched, eventually deciding to pull the trigger on the entire position around $60 as the stock started falling. I exited the entire position between $55-$60.\n\nChart for this time period is below.\n\n[TLRY - 6 mos. Chart](https://preview.redd.it/m38wqe3wgqvd1.png?width=1601&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2fd3997fa22676b05c83ca973be9bb4435236c4)\n\nThe % gain on the position was massive, both in liquidation of the long shares and, especially the Calls. In this case, my prudence still limited the gain to a % of what it could have been because I am never willing to allow a speculative position to occupy too heavy a weight due to risk management. It\'s fun to dream what this trade could have yielded if I was a true WSB degenerate but it was still quite sizable and material to the overall account. For relation, even as a right-sized speculation weight, the gain from this single trade boosted the account value by more than 25%, in a tax-advantaged account.\n\nTLRY is now back to $1.50 per share. It\'s model continues to erode. The fervor is gone but the potential remains simply due to history. TLRY is also a perfect example of one of my Phoenix trades (you can search for that on this sub). At one point in the past, TLRY spiked to $300. That is an important aspect to a phoenix trade.\n\nThis is how speculation can work but, in most cases, it does not. Traders chase profits like these but a vast majority of time it ends in fire and flames, bag holders and loss porn. Sometimes a big gain is the worst thing an individual can have. Those without discipline to understand fear, greed and gambling are lined up for a trip to complete ruin.

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'The New Xbox Console: Reviews and First Impressions', 'content': ""https://preview.redd.it/admyvo4vjxvd1.jpg?width=522&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a472c429a44ca37d200e8ee60d05434de90cc9c2\n\n# \n\nOn sale on Amazon:\xa0[https://amzn.to/Xbox Series X 1TB SSD Console](https://amzn.to/4eMGRvz)  \n\n\n\n\nThe latest iteration of the Xbox console has been eagerly anticipated by gamers worldwide. With its powerful specs, improved controller, and game-changing features, early reviews are pouring in. Here's a breakdown of what users and critics are saying about this next-gen gaming powerhouse.\n\n# 1.\xa0Performance: A Gaming Beast\n\nOne of the most talked-about aspects of the new Xbox is its sheer performance. Equipped with a custom AMD processor, the console promises lightning-fast load times and seamless gameplay, even in the most graphically demanding titles. Users have noted how smooth the experience feels, particularly with games running at 120 FPS and the enhanced support for 4K resolution. Many are impressed by the speed of the SSD, which drastically cuts down load times, keeping players in the action longer.\n\n*Verdict: 9/10 — A leap forward in performance, setting new standards for home consoles.*\n\n# 2.\xa0Backward Compatibility: A Huge Win\n\nOne feature that has gained the Xbox a lot of positive reviews is its backward compatibility. Gamers who have amassed large libraries of Xbox One and even Xbox 360 games can play them on the new console without a hitch. Even better, older games are enhanced to take advantage of the new hardware, offering improved frame rates and better resolution.\n\n*Verdict: 8.5/10 — Seamless backward compatibility gives new life to classic titles.*\n\n# 3.\xa0Design: A Sleek Yet Functional Look\n\nThe design of the new Xbox is a departure from previous models, opting for a minimalist, monolithic shape. While some users appreciate the sleek, modern aesthetic that blends well with home entertainment setups, others have mentioned its size as a potential issue, depending on their space.\n\nThe console is quiet, even during long gaming sessions, thanks to its innovative cooling system, which ensures it runs efficiently without generating much noise.\n\n*Verdict: 7.5/10 — A bold, futuristic design, though some users may need to rearrange their setups to accommodate its size.*\n\n# 4.\xa0Controller: Refining a Classic\n\nThe Xbox controller has long been a fan favorite, and the new version makes subtle yet effective improvements. The grip feels more comfortable, the triggers have been fine-tuned for better feedback, and the share button is a welcome addition for streamers and content creators. However, some have noted that, while great, it doesn’t feel like a major leap compared to its predecessor.\n\n*Verdict: 8/10 — A refined, comfortable controller, though not a massive upgrade.*\n\n# 5.\xa0Game Library: Promising, But Needs More Exclusives\n\nWhile the new Xbox supports a vast range of third-party titles and backward-compatible games, some critics have pointed out that the launch lineup lacks the exclusive games that traditionally drive console sales. Games like\xa0*Halo Infinite*\xa0are highly anticipated, but delays have left some fans feeling like the library could be stronger.\n\nThat being said, Game Pass continues to be a major selling point. With access to hundreds of games from day one, including new releases, it remains one of the best deals in gaming.\n\n*Verdict: 7/10 — A solid game library bolstered by Game Pass, but some exclusive titles are missing at launch.*\n\n# 6.\xa0Future-Proofing: Ready for the Next Generation\n\nAnother standout feature is the console’s future-proof design. With support for 8K resolution, ray tracing, and 120Hz refresh rates, the new Xbox is clearly designed to last for years to come. This is an exciting prospect for gamers who want to invest in a console that will remain relevant as technology continues to advance.\n\n*Verdict: 9/10 — Built for the future, ensuring longevity in a rapidly evolving market.*\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe new Xbox console has impressed critics and gamers alike with its high-end performance, backward compatibility, and refined controller design.

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'Graviola: La Fruta Milagrosa y sus Propiedades Curativas, Especialmente contra el Cáncer', 'content': '# \n\n\xa0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/61j5kbphixvd1.jpg?width=459&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b35299474dc11fa6a97a4f579b9809471a3a8d9\n\n\n\n# En Ventas en Amazon \n\n[https://amzn.to/Graviola Extract 2000 mg 120 Capsules](https://amzn.to/489QnGJ)  \n\n\nLa graviola, también conocida como guanábana (Annona muricata), es una fruta tropical originaria de América Central y Sudamérica que ha sido objeto de numerosas investigaciones debido a sus sorprendentes propiedades medicinales. Este fruto ha sido utilizado tradicionalmente en la medicina natural para tratar una amplia variedad de enfermedades, desde infecciones hasta problemas digestivos. Sin embargo, lo que ha capturado mayor atención en años recientes es su potencial como tratamiento complementario para combatir el cáncer.\n\n# Composición y Propiedades de la Graviola\n\nLa graviola es rica en compuestos bioactivos, principalmente acetogeninas de annonáceas, que se han identificado como los componentes más potentes contra las células cancerígenas. Estos compuestos tienen la capacidad de inhibir la producción de energía en las mitocondrias de las células malignas, lo que provoca su muerte sin afectar gravemente a las células sanas . Además de las acetogeninas, la graviola contiene antioxidantes, vitaminas (como la vitamina C), minerales (calcio, magnesio y potasio) y fibra, lo que la convierte en un excelente refuerzo para el sistema inmunológico.\n\n# Beneficios para la Salud\n\n1. **Efecto Anticancerígeno**: Diversos estudios en laboratorios han mostrado que los extractos de graviola son eficaces para inhibir el crecimiento de células cancerosas en varios tipos de cáncer, incluyendo el cáncer de mama, colon, próstata y pulmón. Las acetogeninas, como mencionamos antes, son los compuestos clave, ya que bloquean selectivamente las células malignas, impidiendo su reproducción.Un estudio publicado por el\xa0*Journal of Natural Products*\xa0destacó que las acetogeninas de la graviola son entre 10,000 y 10,000 veces más efectivas que la quimioterapia convencional, sin los efectos secundarios debilitantes que suelen asociarse a este tratamiento . Sin embargo, es importante señalar que la mayoría de estos estudios se han realizado en entornos de laboratorio, y aún falta más investigación clínica en humanos para confirmar su eficacia total .\n2. **Propiedades Antioxidantes**: Los antioxidantes presentes en la graviola ayudan a combatir el estrés oxidativo, que está relacionado con el envejecimiento prematuro y el desarrollo de enfermedades crónicas, incluido el cáncer. Los antioxidantes neutralizan los radicales libres en el cuerpo, lo que contribuye a la protección de las células .\n3. **Sistema Inmunológico**: La alta concentración de vitamina C en la graviola refuerza el sistema inmunológico, ayudando al cuerpo a combatir infecciones y otras enfermedades. Un sistema inmunológico fuerte es esencial para prevenir la aparición de enfermedades, incluido el cáncer .\n4. **Propiedades Anti-inflamatorias y Analgésicas**: La graviola ha sido utilizada en la medicina tradicional para tratar dolencias como la inflamación y el dolor crónico . Estas propiedades la convierten en un aliado para pacientes con cáncer que buscan alivio de los efectos secundarios de los tratamientos convencionales.\n5. **Salud Digestiva y Antimicrobiana**: La graviola es conocida por sus efectos beneficiosos sobre el sistema digestivo, ayudando a combatir infecciones bacterianas, parásitos y hongos . Además, sus propiedades antimicrobianas pueden proteger al organismo durante momentos de debilidad, como durante el tratamiento del cáncer.\n\n# ¿Cómo se Consume la Graviola?\n\nLa graviola se puede consumir de varias formas:\n\n* **Fruta fresca**: Se puede comer directamente la pulpa de la fruta, que tiene un sabor dulce y ácido.\n* **Té de hojas de graviola**: Las hojas de graviola se han utilizado tradicionalmente para hacer té, conocido por sus efectos calmantes y medicinales .\n* **Suplementos**: Existen cápsulas y extractos concentrados de graviola disponibles en tiendas de productos naturales y herbolarios.\n\nSe recomienda consultar a un médico antes de comenzar a consumir graviola, especialmente si se está bajo tratamiento médico, ya que puede haber interacciones con medicamentos .\n\n# Consideraciones Finales\n\nAunque la graviola muestra un gran potencial como tratamiento complementario en la lucha contra el cáncer, es esencial recordar que no debe reemplazar los tratamientos médicos convencionales. Los estudios en humanos son limitados, y el uso de la graviola debe ser supervisado por un profesional de la salud. Aún así, su uso como apoyo a los tratamientos convencionales, junto con una dieta equilibrada y un estilo de vida saludable, puede proporcionar múltiples beneficios para la salud.\n\nLa graviola, con su impresionante perfil de nutrientes y compuestos bioactivos, sigue captando la atención de la ciencia moderna. Su posible papel en la prevención y tratamiento del cáncer es solo una de las muchas razones por las que esta fruta tropical merece un lugar destacado en nuestra alimentación y en la investigación médica futura.\n\n\n\n\n\n[TV LAVIN: Graviola: La Fruta Milagrosa y sus Propiedades Curativas, Especialmente contra el Cáncer](https://tvlavin.blogspot.com/2024/10/graviola-la-fruta-milagrosa-y-sus.html)\n\n# \n\n\xa0'}"

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': '40M @ $3.4M NW…Finally Free 🔥', 'content': '**ME**. 40M, single, never married with adult kid. Lived in Europe and in America as a child. Moved around the US often as an adult. Started life in middle class, always had the basics like shelter, food, healthcare, although both parents came from slightly above poverty households. Family not particularly close, after 16 it felt like I was emancipated and have been on my own ever since. My life goals at 18 were to have a car, apartment and make $35K/yr which was enough for the “good life” in the LCOL area. Relationship wise I want a life partner but have zero desire for children.\n\n**CAREER**. Tech exec with $980K annual comp. Multiple STEM degrees, technical certifications, business degree and certifications. First half of my career was in a “*boring industry*”, switched to tech and never looked back. Stayed around emerging (new) technologies as I knew with limited experience I could get paid top dollar.\n\n**RELATIONSHIP WITH MONEY**. It’s toxic AF ☺️…seriously, through listening, research and therapy I realized I equate money to safety. Most of my life I’ve had zero support and needed to save money to take care of myself and child or else I felt I’d be out on the street homeless. The environment I came from felt unsafe (e.g. held at gunpoint as a teenager) so the idea of no money, on the streets homeless and a lack of ability to keep myself safe was frightening and not something I would let happen. This emotional state stayed with me through making hundreds of thousands of dollars resulting in comparatively small spending vs my pay as I needed to save it all or else I’d be homeless or destitute, even when making hundreds of thousands with less than $100K in annual expenses.\n\n**FIRE INTRODUCTION**. I originally hated FIRE as everyone thought I jumped on a FIRE bandwagon although I’ve been planning for early retirement since 17. I watched a few FIRE people on YouTube, which made me want to further stay away from the group as they seem like sleezeballs and not knowledgeable. Eventually I got exposed to the right communities and found people in similar situations to me, with more knowledge than me across various topics (e.g. taxes) and felt the portion of the FIRE community I engaged with is an asset and accelerated my growth. I can’t overstate how important it was to have others in a similar situation as me that I could ask questions to for navigating a unique, somewhat taboo situation. The reason I’m sharing in the event it helps someone else.\n\n**DECISION TO RETIRE**. I made a plan at 17 to retire early at 45 as I rationalized “everyone hates their jobs, might as well save up a lot of money and escape that hell sooner than later.” I realize now the negative viewpoint was driven by the adults in my life that I saw not enjoying work. This viewpoint also stayed with me throughout my career, probably allowing me to suffer and deal with more shit because I expected work to be bad. More bad stuff I deAlt with (vs just complaining) the higher I rose. This thought process broke for me when I was making $1M/yr at $1T company. There were three people between me and the CEO and I did not envy or want any of their jobs. I saw people lose their family members and could only take off one day to mourn over a three-day weekend because they were a busy, important executive and couldn’t step away. Another guy literally had a broken back and was in meetings slouched over a chair versus recovering. One person looked like at any given moment, they would have a stroke and die. Their eyes were always twitching and they had pretty bad health. I asked myself, if they are making way more than $1M a year and have a high net worth but can’t prioritize their health or family any more than someone working a low-level factory job, what is the use? At the same time I found all the sacrifices I made to get to the top were now extremely difficult if not impossible. Once I had FI, for lack of better words, I gave no fucks. I actually loved to work and shaping industries for emerging technologies but hated the political nature which was the primary part of my role as an exec, not the technology. Work became no fun and not necessary so I decided to retire, although it took a lot of emotional turmoil to get to the point of pulling the trigger. Almost as soon as I decided I no longer need to work for money, my dream company came along and offered me a job at $2M/year. I LoL’d, thought the universe was really trying to test my resolve and declined the role.\n\n**FIRE TARGET**. This was a continually moving goal, and not for practical reasons. As mentioned, money is security for me so the more neurotic I got the larger the FIRE number I needed to feel secure. It didn’t help to have many coworkers that were multimillionaires telling me anything under $5M net worth is the equivalent of being in poverty and I shouldn’t stop until at least $15M. Ironically, these people were at or past those numbers and still mostly unhappy. Also my 90% safe SWR is 4.84% (not 4%) and my bulletproof SWR is 4.04% (not 3.25%). My original FIRE target was $10K/mo or $2.5M. That number changed at some point to $5M but then got back to where I settled which was $2.7M. At $2.7M or $11K/mo I was no longer trading off time for money.\n\n**RETIREMENT BUDGET**. Before retiring my spend was roughly $7K/mo or $84K/year. In a MCOL city I stayed in a luxury high-rise ($2,700), drove a luxury vehicle ($1,100), had a healthy food budget ($1,750), got regular massages ($400) and had disposable income ($1,000+) left over. That is in addition to investing the majority of my income. My retirement budget differs in the fact that I will no longer be living in the US, which winds up being cheaper (e.g. health insurance) for a better quality of life. Of the places I’ve looked at, either $5K/mo (e.g. SE Asia, LATAM) or $8K/mo (e.g. Europe, Middle East) was enough to live an upper class life (#ChubbyFire). Actual expenses below for two MCOL cities, one in the US (as backup) and my international destination.\n\n**Budget A (International |**  $6,700 Total**)**\n\n* Rent: $3,500\n* Transportation: $400 (private driver, Lexus)\n* Food: $1,500\n* Insurance: $400\n* Gym: $200\n* Massage: $400\n* Misc: $300\n\n**Budget B (US |** $8,800 Total**)**\n\n* $1,500 BMW i4\n* $1,750 Food\n* $3,750 Luxury High-rise premier zipcode\n* $850 Insurance\n* $300 Misc bills, subscriptions\n* $400 Massages\n* $250 Gym\n\n**PORTFOLIO**. Breakout of $3.4M NW.\n\n* **HYSA**: $651K - all from a recent influx of cash. To protect both of us it’s better I don’t disclose how and you don’t ask 😉. Will most likely invest $500K of this, but still determining where. Currently sits in Vanguard Federal (VMFXX).\n* **Bank**: $8K - random transactional cash. Try to keep this at $20K or less.\n* **Crypto**: $235K - started at $70K, got up to $450K. Will sell next time it hits $400K+\n* **Investment (post-tax)**: $2,415K - Includes VTSAX, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, KO, AMD, QCOM. Most of the money is in VTSAX, periodically I got hundred thousand dollar bonuses and go into an individual stock if I saw they were significantly undervalued and I knew enough about the industry to make a relevant call on the stock’s value (e.g. picking tech vs healthcare companies).\n* **Investment (pre-tax)**: $100K - 401(k). Used sparingly as I knew I didn’t want money tied in an account I didn’t have access to until late 60s which also incurs early withdrawal tax penalties. 100% of the retirement is a VTSAX equivalent.\xa0\n\n$3.4M total. 4.84% SWR: $13,713/mo. Left Over After Expenses: $7K/mo\xa0 (internationally) and $5K/mo (US).\n\n**SWR PHILOSOPHY**: As mentioned, my relationship with money was driven by fear/insecurity/generally bad stuff. This impacted my SWR by making me pick the lowest possible percentage that was “guaranteed” to be safe. As I’ve matured closer to retirement, I realize there is no guarantees. I also believe that retiring is not a one-way door, meaning I am retiring from trading my time for money but can return whenever I’d like (albeit for less pay). I also don’t think FIRE equates to not generating money ever again in life. I believe it almost impossible to not generate money ever again as I’m entrepreneurial minded. I’ll now just be doing things for myself and out of enjoyment versus to monetize. I also have the luxury of only needing a SWR of 2.4% to cover all my expenses. Each month I will try to “spend up to” the 4.84% which admittedly will be a struggle but I’m committed to it post reading Die With Zero. The “spend up to” SWR philosophy helps in at least two ways. **1**) If my portfolio gets cut in half and spending gets cut in half, my core lifestyle doesn’t change. I’ve always lived on a fraction of my income so living below my means is easy, living at my means is the hard part. **2**) The ability to significantly cut expenses each month is one of the better safety mechanisms in retirement. There are calculators online that allow you to put in monthly spend fluctuation. The bigger the adjustment you’re able to make, you can either withdraw more money or have a higher probability of success with the same amount of money. I don’t want more money, as I’m struggling to spend what I have but I do want the increased probability of staying successfully retired.\n\n**DEBT**. I have none. No car payment, house payment, student loans, credit card bills, etc.\n\n**TAXES**. I don’t normally factor these in. I expect to take around $120K/yr which I get a standard deduction of $20K and the first $40K/year in capital gains are tax free. As example, taking out $120K, $90K of it is taxable ($30K is the OG investment) and I’d pay 15% or $4.5K ($90K minus $60K tax exempt portion) or $375/mo in taxes. The low effective tax doesn’t change much if I go from $120K to a $165K withdrawal, and as I live well below my top monthly SWR taxes at these levels are negligible.\n\n**ADVICE (recommendations).** Primary advice I’d give below…\n\n1. **Prioritize Health & Relationships**. It’s the most important thing. You can have money but not your health and probably aren’t going to enjoy life. To get to a multimillionaire status before the age of 40 you will probably have to prioritize work/wealth generation over a lot of things, but I don’t recommend consistently prioritizing work over your health and family/relationships. Both can make you spiritually rich and help you become financially rich.\n2. \xa0**Find Internal Validation**. One of the hardest parts about retiring is losing the validation I got through work. Making $1 million a year, having a nice title, getting access to things others didn’t as I was an executive, etc. all went to my head. Not immediately, not even noticeably but eventually. If most or all of your validation comes from the company you’re at, the work you do and the money you’re getting paid then retiring will be very difficult, regardless of how much money you have. I’ve seen many people post, “*I’m 60, have $XM NW and my health is failing me, I hate my job but don’t know what else to do. I have no friends, personal life, hobbies so I just stay working…*” I’ve never been in this state but do feel for these people. You can avoid the negative state by being able to self validate, which is important for something like FIRE. You are in a unique situation, you’re doing things the average person will never do so you’re not going to get validation from the masses. If anything you’re going to get told the opposite: “don’t do it, you’re foolish, it’ll never work, why are you wasting your time?” If you can make a decision, do the research and draw a logical conclusion and stick to that you will have a better FIRE experience. Same is true with the need for Reddit validation (e.g. “I read your plan, love it! I’m rooting for you and everyone else does plans like these and they always succeeded, you’ll be fine!”).\n3. **Avoid Financial Neurosis**. Most of western society is focused on overindulgence and mass consumption at the cost of being in debt, slave to corporations, declining mental and physical health, etc. While it was very clear to me spending compulsively is unhealthy, it took a long time to realize my relationship of saving compulsively was unhealthy too. With money I was the equivalent of one of these reality TV show hoarders, well past being an efficient saver because of all of the negative emotions associated with my relationship with money. I see post after post that reads something along the lines of, “*I am unhappy, hate my job, have struggling relationships, my health is failing me and I have $XM NW, can I retire? I’m afraid to…*” That kind of attachment to money/work is unhealthy to me. While I’ve benefited from it, as corporate America rewards and is built on people that think like this, I’ve also suffered from it. I pray others focus on their relationship with money, maintaining a healthy balance and setting appropriate boundaries.\n4. **Use Lifestyle Arbitrage**. As I worked in tech, many friends/associates live in HCOL areas across the West Coast. My $90K/yr MCOL budget was $200K/yr for them for the same lifestyle. For people currently struggling with jobs they hate or who don’t want to have a large FIRE number to support living in a HCOL city, move to a L/MCOL city. For example $1.5M FIRE number ($6K/mo) gives you a good to great life in Lisbon, Mexico City, Bangkok, Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona and many cities across the US. At $2.5M ($10K/mo) I wouldn’t feel comfortable living in a HCOL city like NY or San Francisco where at $100K you can still apply for government assistance as you are considered at the poverty line. If you are unhappy, unhealthy, and can retire earlier and it just requires moving…then move.\xa0\n\n**WHAT’S NEXT**. Another reason I decided to retire was work was getting in the way. I had a lot of hobbies and could not explore them fully. This allowed me to “retire to something” vs “retire from something” which is the difference of running to something you enjoy vs running away from something you hate (former creates better mental health). I enjoy creating which manifest in music and film production, writing short stories and scripts and I’ve written a book. I also like to travel, workout, play sports, attend live sporting events, live music events, plays/theater, watch TV shows, movies, play video games, read, some lounges/parties, etc. I plan to explore these hobbies fully and do things I never got to do (e.g. skiing) while I still have the physical health to do so. In addition to tech, I’ve also worked as a college professor at some top universities. I’m offered up to $1,500 per hour for consulting. Originally, when I planned to retire, I said that I would do both of these things but now I can see I was making the decision from a bad place mentally. I found I need to retire, take some time off of work to just relax and be, then make a decision on what I want to do next. A friend group who retired early from selling a startup told me they had plans on what they would do when they got the money, but it came from their overworked corporate mind which could rationalize spending time consulting or doing some modification of their existing work (not truly stepping away). When they did retire, as example, one guy who was going to consult wound up being a substitute teacher. When I asked him why he said, he never planned on it but realize after FIRE that substitution was one of the few jobs he could have which didn’t require him to work every day and didn’t require him to miss taking his kids to and from school as he works during their school hours. So I too am leaving the space open to allow myself to formulate what I want to do next.\xa0\n\nAnd that’s all I can think of. Hope this helps. 😎✌🏾\n\nLet me know if you have any FIRE related questions to the above content (not interested in giving career advice, diving into personal non-FIRE topics, etc). '}"

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': '40M @ $3.4M NW…Finally Free 🔥', 'content': '**ME**. 40M, single, never married with adult kid. Lived in Europe and in America as a child. Moved around the US often as an adult. Started life in middle class, always had the basics like shelter, food, healthcare, although both parents came from slightly above poverty households. Family not particularly close, after 16 it felt like I was emancipated and have been on my own ever since. My life goals at 18 were to have a car, apartment and make $35K/yr which was enough for the “good life” in the LCOL area. Relationship wise I want a life partner but have zero desire for children.\n\n**CAREER**. Tech exec with $980K annual comp. Multiple STEM degrees, technical certifications, business degree and certifications. First half of my career was in a “*boring industry*”, switched to tech and never looked back. Stayed around emerging (new) technologies as I knew with limited experience I could get paid top dollar.\n\n**RELATIONSHIP WITH MONEY**. It’s toxic AF ☺️…seriously, through listening, research and therapy I realized I equate money to safety. Most of my life I’ve had zero support and needed to save money to take care of myself and child or else I felt I’d be out on the street homeless. The environment I came from felt unsafe (e.g. held at gunpoint as a teenager) so the idea of no money, on the streets homeless and a lack of ability to keep myself safe was frightening and not something I would let happen. This emotional state stayed with me through making hundreds of thousands of dollars resulting in comparatively small spending vs my pay as I needed to save it all or else I’d be homeless or destitute, even when making hundreds of thousands with less than $100K in annual expenses.\n\n**FIRE INTRODUCTION**. I originally hated FIRE as everyone thought I jumped on a FIRE bandwagon although I’ve been planning for early retirement since 17. I watched a few FIRE people on YouTube, which made me want to further stay away from the group as they seem like sleezeballs and not knowledgeable. Eventually I got exposed to the right communities and found people in similar situations to me, with more knowledge than me across various topics (e.g. taxes) and felt the portion of the FIRE community I engaged with is an asset and accelerated my growth. I can’t overstate how important it was to have others in a similar situation as me that I could ask questions to for navigating a unique, somewhat taboo situation. The reason I’m sharing in the event it helps someone else.\n\n**DECISION TO RETIRE**. I made a plan at 17 to retire early at 45 as I rationalized “everyone hates their jobs, might as well save up a lot of money and escape that hell sooner than later.” I realize now the negative viewpoint was driven by the adults in my life that I saw not enjoying work. This viewpoint also stayed with me throughout my career, probably allowing me to suffer and deal with more shit because I expected work to be bad. More bad stuff I deAlt with (vs just complaining) the higher I rose. This thought process broke for me when I was making $1M/yr at $1T company. There were three people between me and the CEO and I did not envy or want any of their jobs. I saw people lose their family members and could only take off one day to mourn over a three-day weekend because they were a busy, important executive and couldn’t step away. Another guy literally had a broken back and was in meetings slouched over a chair versus recovering. One person looked like at any given moment, they would have a stroke and die. Their eyes were always twitching and they had pretty bad health. I asked myself, if they are making way more than $1M a year and have a high net worth but can’t prioritize their health or family any more than someone working a low-level factory job, what is the use? At the same time I found all the sacrifices I made to get to the top were now extremely difficult if not impossible. Once I had FI, for lack of better words, I gave no fucks. I actually loved to work and shaping industries for emerging technologies but hated the political nature which was the primary part of my role as an exec, not the technology. Work became no fun and not necessary so I decided to retire, although it took a lot of emotional turmoil to get to the point of pulling the trigger. Almost as soon as I decided I no longer need to work for money, my dream company came along and offered me a job at $2M/year. I LoL’d, thought the universe was really trying to test my resolve and declined the role.\n\n**FIRE TARGET**. This was a continually moving goal, and not for practical reasons. As mentioned, money is security for me so the more neurotic I got the larger the FIRE number I needed to feel secure. It didn’t help to have many coworkers that were multimillionaires telling me anything under $5M net worth is the equivalent of being in poverty and I shouldn’t stop until at least $15M. Ironically, these people were at or past those numbers and still mostly unhappy. Also my 90% safe SWR is 4.84% (not 4%) and my bulletproof SWR is 4.04% (not 3.25%). My original FIRE target was $10K/mo or $2.5M. That number changed at some point to $5M but then got back to where I settled which was $2.7M. At $2.7M or $11K/mo I was no longer trading off time for money.\n\n**RETIREMENT BUDGET**. Before retiring my spend was roughly $7K/mo or $84K/year. In a MCOL city I stayed in a luxury high-rise ($2,700), drove a luxury vehicle ($1,100), had a healthy food budget ($1,750), got regular massages ($400) and had disposable income ($1,000+) left over. That is in addition to investing the majority of my income. My retirement budget differs in the fact that I will no longer be living in the US, which winds up being cheaper (e.g. health insurance) for a better quality of life. Of the places I’ve looked at, either $5K/mo (e.g. SE Asia, LATAM) or $8K/mo (e.g. Europe, Middle East) was enough to live an upper class life (#ChubbyFire). Actual expenses below for two MCOL cities, one in the US (as backup) and my international destination.\n\n**Budget A (International |**  $6,700 Total**)**\n\n* Rent: $3,500\n* Transportation: $400 (private driver, Lexus)\n* Food: $1,500\n* Insurance: $400\n* Gym: $200\n* Massage: $400\n* Misc: $300\n\n**Budget B (US |** $8,800 Total**)**\n\n* $1,500 BMW i4\n* $1,750 Food\n* $3,750 Luxury High-rise premier zipcode\n* $850 Insurance\n* $300 Misc bills, subscriptions\n* $400 Massages\n* $250 Gym\n\n**PORTFOLIO**. Breakout of $3.4M NW.\n\n* **HYSA**: $651K - all from a recent influx of cash. To protect both of us it’s better I don’t disclose how and you don’t ask 😉. Will most likely invest $500K of this, but still determining where. Currently sits in Vanguard Federal (VMFXX).\n* **Bank**: $8K - random transactional cash. Try to keep this at $20K or less.\n* **Crypto**: $235K - started at $70K, got up to $450K. Will sell next time it hits $400K+\n* **Investment (post-tax)**: $2,415K - Includes VTSAX, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, KO, AMD, QCOM. Most of the money is in VTSAX, periodically I got hundred thousand dollar bonuses and go into an individual stock if I saw they were significantly undervalued and I knew enough about the industry to make a relevant call on the stock’s value (e.g. picking tech vs healthcare companies).\n* **Investment (pre-tax)**: $100K - 401(k). Used sparingly as I knew I didn’t want money tied in an account I didn’t have access to until late 60s which also incurs early withdrawal tax penalties. 100% of the retirement is a VTSAX equivalent.\xa0\n\n$3.4M total. 4.84% SWR: $13,713/mo. Left Over After Expenses: $7K/mo\xa0 (internationally) and $5K/mo (US).\n\n**SWR PHILOSOPHY**: As mentioned, my relationship with money was driven by fear/insecurity/generally bad stuff. This impacted my SWR by making me pick the lowest possible percentage that was “guaranteed” to be safe. As I’ve matured closer to retirement, I realize there is no guarantees. I also believe that retiring is not a one-way door, meaning I am retiring from trading my time for money but can return whenever I’d like (albeit for less pay). I also don’t think FIRE equates to not generating money ever again in life. I believe it almost impossible to not generate money ever again as I’m entrepreneurial minded. I’ll now just be doing things for myself and out of enjoyment versus to monetize. I also have the luxury of only needing a SWR of 2.4% to cover all my expenses. Each month I will try to “spend up to” the 4.84% which admittedly will be a struggle but I’m committed to it post reading Die With Zero. The “spend up to” SWR philosophy helps in at least two ways. **1**) If my portfolio gets cut in half and spending gets cut in half, my core lifestyle doesn’t change. I’ve always lived on a fraction of my income so living below my means is easy, living at my means is the hard part. **2**) The ability to significantly cut expenses each month is one of the better safety mechanisms in retirement. There are calculators online that allow you to put in monthly spend fluctuation. The bigger the adjustment you’re able to make, you can either withdraw more money or have a higher probability of success with the same amount of money. I don’t want more money, as I’m struggling to spend what I have but I do want the increased probability of staying successfully retired.\n\n**DEBT**. I have none. No car payment, house payment, student loans, credit card bills, etc.\n\n**TAXES**. I don’t normally factor these in. I expect to take around $120K/yr which I get a standard deduction of $20K and the first $40K/year in capital gains are tax free. As example, taking out $120K, $90K of it is taxable ($30K is the OG investment) and I’d pay 15% or $4.5K ($90K minus $60K tax exempt portion) or $375/mo in taxes. The low effective tax doesn’t change much if I go from $120K to a $165K withdrawal, and as I live well below my top monthly SWR taxes at these levels are negligible.\n\n**ADVICE (recommendations).** Primary advice I’d give below…\n\n1. **Prioritize Health & Relationships**. It’s the most important thing. You can have money but not your health and probably aren’t going to enjoy life. To get to a multimillionaire status before the age of 40 you will probably have to prioritize work/wealth generation over a lot of things, but I don’t recommend consistently prioritizing work over your health and family/relationships.

An 8GB Nvidia T1000 is passed through to my media VM (Plex and Blue Iris). The other hypervisor is powered on, on demand and contains multiple dev VM\'s which are hosted on the Synology (iSCSI) on 4 x 3.84TB SATA SSD\'s (RAID10) which are connected to via 10Gbe DAC.\n\nI\'ve always wanted to consolodate everything, but have been put off by the power consumption (and noise) of enterprise servers. My current setup including PoE switch is about \\~180W, increasing to \\~210W with the second Optiplex fired up.\n\nI recently stumbled across the QNAP TS-h1290FX NAS (https://www.qnap.com/en-uk/product/ts-h1290fx), however, it is way too expensive, even for the entry model, which is £4000.00 on offer! And it also has way too many extra\'s such as 25Gbe which I don\'t need. The form factor and the fact it is all U.2 NVMe is attractive.\n\nThe documentation states that power consumption is 134W typical, which I find optomistic as U.2 can be \\~20 - 25W each.\n\nSo, getting to the point, I\'m thinking about the feasibility of self-building something similar.\n\nI can\'t seem to find a case that is a similar form factor, and anything close (Silverstone CS381) has 8 bays, and already has a SATA backplane - I wanted U.2 NVMe.\n\nI may have to go rackmount, which is not an issue as I have a Dell 42U cabinet.\n\nThis one seems to fit the bill - [https://amzn.eu/d/4Or7d3p](https://amzn.eu/d/4Or7d3p)\n\nAlong with this motherboard - [https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/motherboard/h12ssl-i](https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/motherboard/h12ssl-i)\n\nThe AMD EPYC 7302P 16 core CPU will be fine for my use (which is also used in the higher end QNAP TS-h1290FX).\n\nI can add multiple 4 x U.2 NVMe\'s to the system using Icy Dock Rugged Full Metal 4 Bay 2.5"" NVMe U.2 SSD Mobile Rack For External 5.25"" Bay.\n\nAnd perhaps 4 x SATA SSD\'s using another ICY DOCK product.\n\nBulk storage will be on 4 x 12TB 3.5"" disks which will fit into the additional drive bays.\n\nWhat is confusing me is how to connect up and power these U.2/SATA SSD/SATA HDD\'s?\n\nI\'ve seen a controller card - LSI 9500-16i, which supports PCIe 4, however, again confusing as it\'s an x8 card, which means that it surely cannot support 4 x U.2 SSD\'s at full speed? - Would I also need 2 of these cards to support 8 x U.2 SSD\'s? And what about cooling them?\n\nAnd finally, what is the best option to provide power and connectivity to the remaining 4 x SATA SSD\'s and 4 x SATA HDD\'s along with cooling?\n\nThank you.\n\n'}"

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'Travel Backpacks for Sporty Travelers: Practical Options', 'content': ""Finding the perfect travel backpack is like choosing the right travel companion — it makes all the difference. For sporty travelers, especially, the ideal travel backpack needs to be durable, practical, and ready to handle anything, from hiking through rugged terrain to navigating airports and cities with ease. Whether you’re searching for the\xa0**best travel backpack**\xa0for outdoor adventures or something stylish yet functional, this guide will walk you through practical options to suit every need.\n\n# Why Choosing the Right Travel Backpack Matters\n\nWhen you’re constantly on the move, having the right\xa0**travel backpack**\xa0is crucial. It should accommodate your essentials and withstand the wear and tear of an active lifestyle. Sporty travelers often need a backpack that can transition seamlessly between outdoor activities like hiking or biking, and city exploration. The key is to find the\xa0**best backpack for travel**\xa0that strikes the right balance between comfort, functionality, and style.\n\nThe wrong backpack can lead to discomfort, and disorganization, and even limit your travel experience. You don’t want to be halfway through a hike only to discover that your straps are digging into your shoulders or your gear isn’t accessible when you need it most. So, let’s dive into the features that make the best\xa0**travel backpacks**\xa0for sporty travelers.\n\n# What to Look for in a Travel Backpack\n\n# 1. Comfort and Fit\n\nSporty travelers are often carrying their gear for long periods, so a comfortable backpack is essential. Look for padded shoulder straps, a well-ventilated back panel, and a chest or waist strap for better weight distribution. If you’re hiking, trekking, or biking, you’ll want a\xa0**travel backpack**\xa0that feels like a natural extension of your body, rather than a burden.\n\n* **Adjustability:**\xa0The more adjustable the straps, the better the fit.\n* **Padding:**\xa0Padded straps help reduce strain on your shoulders and back.\n* **Breathable Material:**\xa0Mesh back panels can prevent sweat buildup, keeping you cool.\n\n# 2. Durability and Weather Resistance\n\nOutdoor adventures often involve unpredictable weather, so a\xa0**best travel backpack**\xa0for sporty travelers should be made from durable, water-resistant material. Look for backpacks made from materials like nylon or polyester that can withstand abrasions and moisture. Some backpacks come with a built-in rain cover, which is a huge plus if you expect wet conditions.\n\n* **Water Resistance:**\xa0Even if you don’t plan on getting caught in the rain, it’s better to be prepared.\n* **Durable Zippers:**\xa0Strong, smooth zippers are a must for keeping your belongings safe.\n\n# 3. Storage and Organization\n\nA well-organized\xa0**travel backpack**\xa0will have multiple compartments and pockets to store everything from your water bottle to your passport. For sporty travelers, hydration compartments, quick-access pockets, and compression straps are incredibly useful. A travel backpack with a separate shoe compartment is ideal for keeping dirty shoes away from clean clothes.\n\n* **Multiple Compartments:**\xa0Keeps gear organized and easy to find.\n* **Laptop Sleeve:**\xa0Even sporty travelers might need to bring a laptop or tablet.\n* **Hydration Compatibility:**\xa0Some backpacks have compartments for hydration bladders, making it easy to drink on the go.\n\n# 4. Size and Weight\n\nWhen choosing the\xa0**best backpack for travel**, you’ll want to consider the size. The volume of a travel backpack is typically measured in liters, with 30–50L being ideal for short to medium trips. If you’re traveling for more than a week, you might want something larger. However, don’t forget to factor in the weight of the backpack itself. A lighter backpack makes it easier to carry heavy gear without adding unnecessary strain.\n\n* **Volume:**\xa0Choose a size that suits your travel needs. 40L is a versatile choice for most sporty travelers.\n* **Weight:**\xa0A lightweight yet sturdy backpack is key for long days on the move.\n\n# Best Travel Backpacks for Sporty Women\n\nWhen it comes to finding the\xa0**best travel backpack for women**, it’s important to look for something that’s designed with a woman’s frame in mind. Women’s backpacks often have shorter torso lengths, narrower shoulder straps, and offer more lumbar support.\n\n# 1. Osprey Fairview 40\n\nThe\xa0[Osprey Fairview 40](https://amzn.to/3BXS0eq)\xa0is consistently rated as one of the\xa0**best travel backpacks for women**. It’s carry-on sized, so no need to check it in, and its comfortable suspension system makes it great for sporty travelers who might be walking long distances or hiking. It’s versatile enough for urban travel yet rugged enough for outdoor adventures. The 40L capacity is ideal for those who pack light but need space for essentials like hiking boots or a rain jacket.\n\n# 2. Deuter ACT Trail 28 SL\n\nThe [Deuter ACT Trail 28 SL](https://amzn.to/4dWX0gF) is a top choice for women who prefer a smaller, sleeker option. It's incredibly comfortable, designed specifically for a woman’s body, with padded straps and a mesh back panel for ventilation. It’s great for sporty travelers who might be exploring mountain trails or bike paths, but also need a functional bag for city travel.\n\n# Best Travel Backpacks for Sporty Men\n\nFor sporty men who need a travel backpack that’s durable, functional, and comfortable, there are several great options available. The\xa0**best travel backpack for men**\xa0will have the same features mentioned earlier, but may also include larger capacities and longer straps for those with bigger frames.\n\n# 1. Osprey Farpoint 40\n\nThe\xa0[Osprey Farpoint 40](https://amzn.to/4h34O3z)\xa0is often hailed as the\xa0**best travel backpack for men**\xa0because of its balance between capacity and comfort. It’s the men’s version of the Fairview, but with a design that fits broader shoulders and longer torsos. Its ruggedness makes it perfect for the outdoors, while the sleek design allows it to transition seamlessly into more urban settings.\n\n# 2. North Face Borealis\n\n[North Face Borealis](https://amzn.to/3AfnM6a)\xa0For those who want the\xa0**best travel backpack**\xa0that’s more geared toward day trips or weekend getaways, the North Face Borealis is a solid choice. It offers a durable design, plenty of pockets, and comes with a 28L capacity that’s more than enough for short adventures. The padded laptop sleeve also makes it a good option for those who work on the go.\n\n# Best General Travel Backpacks for Sporty Travelers\n\nIf you’re looking for something more unisex that works for both men and women or if you’re not picky about gender-specific design, here are a few more versatile options that top the list for sporty travelers.\n\n# 1. Patagonia Black Hole 32L\n\n[Patagonia Black Hole 32L](https://amzn.to/3U8cEib)[\xa0](https://amzn.to/3U8cEib)The Patagonia Black Hole is one of the most durable, weather-resistant backpacks out there, making it perfect for sporty travelers who expect to face tough conditions. The 32L version is ideal for day trips, but the bag comes in larger sizes as well. Its durable fabric can withstand rough handling, and it’s perfect for outdoor activities like hiking or skiing, as well as urban exploration.\n\n# 2. Nomatic Travel Pack\n\n[Nomatic Travel Pack](https://amzn.to/404u975)\xa0For travelers who want a more sleek and modern look, the Nomatic Travel Pack offers a smart design that focuses on organization. It’s great for sporty travelers who like to stay organized but still need a sturdy, versatile bag. With expandable storage and multiple compartments, it’s the\xa0**best backpack for travel**\xa0for those who need to carry a variety of items.\n\n# How to Choose the Right Travel Backpack for Your Activity\n\nChoosing the right\xa0**travel backpack**\xa0often comes down to your specific travel style and the activities you’ll be doing. Here’s a quick breakdown of how to choose the right backpack based on your adventure:\n\n# Hiking and Trekking\n\nLook for a backpack that has a hydration reservoir, a durable frame, and is made from weather-resistant material. Backpacks in the 30–50L range work well for hikes.\n\n# City Exploration\n\nFor city travel, you’ll want something sleek, compact, and stylish but still functional. Look for smaller backpacks (20–30L) with plenty of compartments for organizing daily essentials.\n\n# Multisport Adventures\n\nIf you’re planning to do multiple activities, like biking, hiking, and city exploration, a versatile backpack like the Osprey Farpoint/Fairview 40 or the Patagonia Black Hole will serve you well.\n\n# \n\nFinding the best\xa0**travel backpack**\xa0for sporty travelers requires a balance of comfort, durability, and practicality. From top brands like Osprey, Deuter, and Patagonia, there are plenty of options available to suit every need and activity. Whether you’re looking for the\xa0**best travel backpack for women**, men, or a versatile option that works for everyone, the key is to consider your travel style and the activities you’ll be doing.\n\nWith the right backpack by your side, your next adventure will be that much more enjoyable, ensuring that you’re always ready for whatever the journey throws your way.""}"

Here are some tips on how to approach it thoughtfully:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gubjmqnpsvvd1.jpg?width=390&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd462bb76b90e4a9cb932bfea01fc64e0de51daf\n\n# 1. Be Sure of Your Feelings\n\nBefore proposing, make sure you're genuinely interested in her and ready for a relationship. Ask yourself if you’re prepared for the commitment.\n\n# 2. Build a Strong Connection\n\nIf you haven't already, invest time in getting to know her well. Spend time together, talk openly, and build trust. Ensure she feels comfortable with you and there’s mutual respect.\n\n# 3. Pick the Right Moment\n\nTiming matters. Choose a moment when the two of you are relaxed and alone, so you can talk without interruptions. Avoid public or pressured settings unless you're sure she's comfortable with that.\n\n# 4. Express Your Feelings Honestly\n\nBe genuine when telling her how you feel. A simple and heartfelt expression like, “I’ve developed strong feelings for you, and I’d love for us to take things to the next level,” can work wonders. Let her know what makes her special to you.\n\n# 5. Listen to Her Feelings\n\nAfter expressing your feelings, give her space to respond. Respect her feelings, whether they align with yours or not. It's important to have open and honest communication.\n\n# 6. Respect Her Decision\n\nWhether she says yes or no, be respectful of her decision. If she needs time to think about it, give her that space without pressuring her. If she’s not interested, accept it gracefully.\n\n# 7. Be Prepared for Any Outcome\n\nNot every proposal results in a relationship, so be ready for all possibilities. If she feels the same way, celebrate that! If not, handle it maturely and maintain respect.\n\n# Sample Proposal:\n\n“Hey \\[her name\\], I’ve really enjoyed the time we’ve spent together, and I feel like we have a strong connection. I’ve started to see you as more than just a friend, and I wanted to be honest about my feelings. I’d love for us to explore a relationship together, but I also want you to feel comfortable and to do what feels right for you.”\n\nConfidence, honesty, and respect are key when proposing a relationship.\n\nPromise Ring Set for a Beautiful Girl [Check-in ](https://amzn.to/3YwbD6g)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfm3ohdrsvvd1.jpg?width=1464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0948df5c882411b14c5ad12255645bdae471b1e3\n\n""}"

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'Labrador Puppy Hair Fall Solution', 'content': ""Labrador puppies are known for their adorable looks and soft coats, but like many other dog breeds, they can experience some hair fall. While shedding is natural, excessive hair loss can be concerning. Here are some simple solutions to help manage and reduce your Labrador puppy’s hair fall:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g82vm2vxjuvd1.jpg?width=595&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71ec7389aa98313cf078d68ee10dc16175a1cdbe\n\n# 1. Regular Brushing\n\nOne of the best ways to reduce hair fall is to brush your Labrador puppy regularly. Labradors have a double coat, meaning they shed a lot, especially during shedding seasons (spring and fall). Use a de-[shedding tool](https://amzn.to/3Yw85kG) or a [slicker brush](https://amzn.to/4dSfNtI) to remove loose hair and prevent it from ending up all over your house.\n\n* **Tip:** Brush your Labrador at least 2-3 times a week to keep shedding under control. During heavy shedding periods, you may need to brush them daily.\n* Best shedding tool [buy now Check-in link](https://amzn.to/3Yw85kG)/[slicker brush ](https://amzn.to/4dSfNtI)\n\n# 2. Balanced Diet\n\nA healthy diet plays a big role in keeping your puppy’s coat healthy. Ensure your Labrador puppy is eating a well-balanced, high-quality diet rich in Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids. These nutrients help maintain healthy skin and coat, reducing hair fall.\n\n* **Tip:** Include fish oil supplements or foods like salmon, flaxseeds, and chia seeds in your puppy's diet to boost their coat health.\n* best [fish oil omega 3 for dogs check-in ](https://amzn.to/4faG47t)\n\n# 3. Regular Bathing\n\nGiving your Labrador puppy a bath every 4-6 weeks can help remove loose hair and keep their skin clean. Use a gentle, dog-specific shampoo that doesn’t dry out their skin, as dry skin can lead to more hair loss.\n\n* **Tip:** Avoid over-bathing, as it can strip the natural oils from your puppy’s skin, leading to more shedding.\n\n# 4. Hydration\n\nDehydration can cause dry skin and lead to increased shedding. Make sure your Labrador puppy always has access to fresh water. Keeping them hydrated promotes healthy skin and coat, which reduces hair fall.\n\n* **Tip:** Monitor your puppy’s water intake, especially in hot weather or after exercise.\n\n# 5. Manage Stress\n\nJust like humans, puppies can experience stress, and stress can sometimes lead to excessive shedding. Ensure your Labrador puppy gets enough exercise, mental stimulation, and affection. This will help them stay happy and relaxed, reducing stress-related hair loss.\n\n* **Tip:** Try interactive [toys](https://amzn.to/409Dt9G), training sessions, and playtime to keep your puppy mentally and physically stimulated.\n* USA Best [Dog Toys Check-in](https://amzn.to/409Dt9G)\n\n# 6. Regular Vet Checkups\n\nExcessive shedding can sometimes be a sign of underlying health problems, such as allergies, skin infections, or hormonal imbalances. If your Labrador puppy’s shedding seems abnormal, it’s a good idea to consult a vet. They can diagnose any health issues and suggest the best treatment.\n\n* **Tip:** Keep up with regular vet visits to ensure your puppy is in good health and not experiencing skin problems or allergies.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nManaging your Labrador puppy’s hair fall is all about good grooming habits, a healthy diet, and regular care. By following these simple steps, you can help keep your puppy’s coat shiny, healthy, and reduce excessive shedding. Remember, a little shedding is natural, but with the right approach, you can minimize the mess! also read [The Dog Grooming Book](https://amzn.to/48fEgYL)""}"

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': ' Cash Management Account - what affects my ability to withdraw?', 'content': ""I was recently looking over the previous threads here on Fidelity's changing Cash Management accounts to allow SPAXX as a core position instead of the FDIC-insured deposit sweep.\n\nThere were a few responses from people who just manually buy a different money market fund (like FDLXX) instead of relying on their core position. That's what I'd prefer, since I'd like the additional safety and state tax advantages of investing only in Treasuries.\n\nBut wouldn't this affect your ability to withdraw funds from the account via check or debit card? Fidelity advertises that the CMA is technically a brokerage account - you could buy whatever securities you wanted in it if you didn't want to hold the whole balance as cash. But then you'd presumably not be able to just go to the ATM and get cash out from that amount - you could only do it from your core account position. \n\nIs this how it works?\n\n**Case A:** you leave the whole balance in the core position, either SPAXX or the FDIC-insured sweep. This one seems straightforward - [you should be able to withdraw](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/faqs-about-account#:~:text=How%20Your%20Core%20Position%20Works,account%20to%20make%20a%20purchase) whatever you want against that balance.\n\n**Case B**: you put some or all of your CMA balance into some relatively-illiquid security. Let's say you buy AMZN stock or the Fidelity Total Bond ETF or whatever with it. I assume that this case is straightforward, too: since the money is tied up in these securities, you need to manually sell them first for the cash to be withdrawable. (Fidelity's not going to liquidate $120 worth of AMZN automatically from your CMA every time you go to the ATM.)\n\n**Case C**: you put some or all of your CMA balance into a non-core-position money market fund like FDLXX. Despite the high liquidity of money market funds, this is still functionally equivalent to Case B, right? Since the money isn't in your core position, and all cash transactions are handled entirely through your core position, checks and whatnot won't be deducted from this amount automatically. Instead, you have to manually go in and sell FDLXX for cash before you can withdraw the cash. \n\nDo I have that right? (If this is correct, consider this post a vote in favor of adding other money market options for the CMA core position.)""}"
Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'The Nature of the Soul by Lucille Cedercrans', 'content': '🌿 **Detailed Overview:**\n\nA profound exploration of the evolutionary shift humanity is undergoing, from self-consciousness to Soul consciousness. Cedercrans emphasizes that every human being is on the precipice of awakening to their Soul, a natural progression driven by the force of evolution. This book provides a series of teachings designed to help individuals recognize and connect with the Soul, encouraging the cultivation of higher awareness and spiritual understanding. Through the practice of meditation and introspection, readers are invited to explore the relationship between the Soul and its lower, material counterpart. Cedercrans offers a new ""Thought-Form Presentation of the Wisdom"" as a tool for spiritual seekers, allowing them to abstract divine knowledge through meditation and translate it into practical understanding for everyday life.\n\n🔍 **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n• **The Evolutionary Shift to Soul Consciousness:** Cedercrans emphasizes that humanity is at a turning point, moving beyond mere self-consciousness toward the greater realization of Soul consciousness. This evolution is a natural and inevitable process, driven by the Soul’s desire to express itself through the physical world. Humanity’s dissatisfaction with materialism is a sign of this inner awakening, a call to seek higher spiritual values.\n\n• **The Soul’s Presence in Mass Consciousness:** The book highlights that the Soul is actively influencing mass consciousness, pushing humanity toward spiritual awakening. Cedercrans notes that this influence is universal, affecting men and women everywhere, often manifesting as restlessness or discontent with material life. The collective search for peace and meaning is an expression of the Soul’s movement within humanity.\n\n• **Meditation as a Path to Soul Recognition:** Central to Cedercrans\' teachings is the practice of meditation, which she describes as the key method for contacting the Soul. Through meditation, individuals can access abstract spiritual wisdom and translate it into practical, concrete understanding. This practice fosters a deeper connection with the Soul and accelerates the process of awakening.\n\n• **The New Thought-Form Presentation of The Wisdom:** Cedercrans introduces a ""New Thought-Form Presentation of The Wisdom,"" a spiritual tool designed to help seekers access higher knowledge through meditation. This presentation represents a modern interpretation of ageless wisdom, providing practical guidance for individuals who are ready to engage with their Soul and the greater spiritual truths of the universe.\n\n• **The Role of the Soul in Personal and Collective Awakening:** The book outlines the Soul’s role in guiding both individual and collective spiritual evolution. As more individuals awaken to their Soul, they contribute to the overall spiritual transformation of humanity. Cedercrans argues that this awakening is the key to bringing lasting peace and harmony to the world, as it aligns humanity with the divine will.\n\n🕊️ **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders will gain a deep understanding of the evolutionary journey toward Soul consciousness and how it is shaping the world today. Through meditation and the application of spiritual wisdom, individuals can cultivate a deeper connection with their Soul and contribute to the collective awakening of humanity. The teachings in *The Nature of the Soul* provide practical tools for spiritual growth and personal transformation, guiding readers toward a more peaceful and purposeful life.\n\n💌 **Your Experiences and Reflections:**\n\nHave you ever felt a deep inner restlessness or dissatisfaction with material life that led you to seek something higher?

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'The Physics of God: How the Deepest Theories of Science Explain Religion and How the Deepest Truths of Religion Explain Science by Joseph Selbie', 'content': '🌿 **Detailed Overview:**\n\nA groundbreaking exploration of the parallels between cutting-edge scientific discoveries and ancient spiritual truths. The book bridges the gap between science and religion, offering an accessible explanation of complex topics such as quantum physics, relativity, neuroscience, and string theory, while drawing connections to spiritual experiences like miracles, immortality, and transcendent awareness. Selbie’s central thesis is that the concepts traditionally labeled as ""spiritual"" or ""mystical"" are not only compatible with, but are deeply supported by modern scientific theories. Through clear metaphors and practical examples, Selbie seeks to dissolve the apparent conflict between science and religion, inviting readers to embrace a unified understanding of reality.\n\n🔍 **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n• **Unity of Science and Spirituality:** Selbie argues that the perceived divide between science and spirituality is an illusion. By examining quantum physics, M-theory, and neuroscience, he reveals that many phenomena described by saints, mystics, and near-death experiences can be explained through the lens of modern science. This unity offers a profound shift in perspective, suggesting that science and religion are two sides of the same coin, both seeking to understand the same ultimate reality.\n\n• **Quantum Biology and Immortality:** One of the book’s more intriguing concepts is how quantum biology provides a scientific explanation for immortality. Selbie explains that human consciousness and the body are entangled in ways that defy traditional biological understanding, suggesting that consciousness persists beyond physical death. This scientific framework mirrors religious teachings on the soul and the afterlife, providing a bridge between faith-based beliefs and empirical research.\n\n• **Transcendent Awareness and the Power of Mind:** Drawing on discoveries in neuroscience and relativity, Selbie emphasizes the mind’s ability to create miracles and bring about instantaneous changes in the physical body. He connects this power to the teachings of spiritual leaders who have long claimed that thoughts and beliefs shape reality. This insight suggests that the human mind has far more control over the physical world than previously understood.\n\n• **Meditation as a Gateway to Transcendence:** The newly added chapter on the physics of meditation delves into how the practice aligns with the brain’s natural frequencies and quantum states. Meditation, according to Selbie, enhances one\'s ability to access transcendent awareness by harmonizing with the energy fields described in quantum physics. This connection provides a scientific basis for the spiritual benefits long attributed to meditative practices.\n\n• **M-Theory and Multidimensional Reality:** The book also connects string theory’s brane worlds—the hidden dimensions of M-theory—to the religious concept of transcendent heavens. Selbie argues that these dimensions are not only scientifically plausible but have been described by spiritual traditions for millennia. This suggests that the ""heavens"" described in religion may be multidimensional realms that science is only beginning to understand.\n\n🕊️ **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders will walk away with a renewed perspective on the compatibility of science and spirituality. Selbie\'s explanations offer hope for those who feel torn between the rationality of science and the transcendence of religion, providing tools for personal transformation through meditation and conscious living. This book is ideal for anyone seeking to reconcile their spiritual beliefs with scientific understanding and for those curious about how the deepest truths of the universe intersect with our daily lives.\n\n💌 **Your Experiences and Reflections:**\n\nHave you ever encountered a spiritual experience that felt deeply connected to scientific principles? How do you think the exploration of quantum physics or neuroscience might change your perspective on life, death, and consciousness?

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'As Above, So Below: Paths to Spiritual Renewal in Daily Life by Ronald S. Miller', 'content': '🌿 **Detailed Overview:**\n\nA profound exploration of spirituality and how it can be integrated into everyday experiences. Drawing on various spiritual traditions, psychological insights, and mythological frameworks, Miller encourages readers to find the extraordinary within the ordinary aspects of their daily lives. The book delves into the wisdom of the Western spiritual tradition, shamanic practices, transpersonal psychology, and feminine spirituality, among others, to create a comprehensive guide for personal and spiritual growth. With an emphasis on holistic understanding, Miller offers a path to renewal that is both practical and deeply transformative.\n\n🔍 **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n• **Spirituality in the Mundane:** Miller emphasizes that spirituality is not something separate from daily life but is found in the ordinary moments that make up our existence. This theme invites readers to look for moments of connection, meaning, and transcendence in the simplest activities—whether it’s in conversations, nature, or even routine tasks—showing that the divine is always present.\n\n• **Western Spiritual Tradition and Transpersonal Psychology:** The book explores the integration of Western spiritual traditions with modern psychological insights, particularly transpersonal psychology, which bridges psychology and spirituality. Miller highlights how Western spirituality, traditionally rooted in religious practices, can evolve to meet the needs of the contemporary seeker, using psychology as a tool for deep self-exploration and spiritual transformation.\n\n• **Shamanism and Mythology as Tools for Renewal:** Drawing on the ancient practices of shamanism and mythological narratives, Miller provides a framework for readers to reconnect with primal sources of wisdom. He shows how shamanic practices can facilitate healing and spiritual renewal by tapping into the unseen realms, and how mythology provides symbolic maps for navigating life’s challenges and transitions.\n\n• **Feminine Spirituality and Holistic Balance:** Miller acknowledges the resurgence of feminine spirituality and its role in balancing the often patriarchal tendencies in traditional religious frameworks. He explores how integrating the feminine—through values like intuition, compassion, and nurturing—can offer a more holistic approach to spiritual growth, contributing to a renewal of both personal and collective consciousness.\n\n• **Paths to Personal Transformation:** The overarching message of the book is that personal transformation is available to everyone, not just through isolated spiritual practices but by engaging fully in life. Miller offers practical advice on how to cultivate mindfulness, develop self-awareness, and create meaningful spiritual practices that align with the flow of daily life, helping readers renew themselves spiritually and emotionally.\n\n🕊️ **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders will discover how spirituality can be woven into the fabric of their daily lives, offering a path to renewal and deeper meaning. Through exploring diverse traditions such as shamanism, mythology, and psychology, they will find accessible tools to transform their everyday experiences into moments of spiritual insight. The book serves as a reminder that personal growth and spiritual transformation do not require grand gestures but are found in living with intention and awareness.\n\n💌 **Your Experiences and Reflections:**\n\nHow do you incorporate spirituality into your daily routine?

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'The End of Your World: Uncensored Straight Talk on the Nature of Enlightenment by Adyashanti ', 'content': '🌿 **Detailed Overview:**\n\nAddresses the often-overlooked phase of spiritual awakening—the period after an individual first ""wakes up"" to a new reality. This book provides a candid, no-frills guide to navigating the complexities and challenges that arise after the initial experience of enlightenment, shedding light on the nuances of what comes next. Adyashanti speaks directly to those who have had spiritual breakthroughs and are seeking direction, emphasizing the common fluctuations between temporary awakening and the more permanent state of abiding enlightenment. This work serves as a practical and spiritual roadmap for living fully in the awakened state.\n\n🔍 **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n• **The Transition from Awakening to Abiding Enlightenment:** Adyashanti introduces the distinction between ""nonabiding"" and ""abiding"" enlightenment, explaining that many people experience awakening in fleeting moments, only to feel that it slips away. He calls this the ""I got it/I lost it"" cycle, which can lead to confusion and frustration. This theme underscores the deeper work required to transition from temporary spiritual experiences to a stable, lived experience of enlightenment.\n\n• **Pitfalls and Traps of the Ego Post-Awakening:** After awakening, the ego can subtly reassert itself, creating a range of obstacles on the path to full realization. Adyashanti warns about common traps such as the illusion of spiritual superiority, where individuals might feel ""better"" or more enlightened than others, and the tendency for the ego to use spiritual insights for its own gain. This theme emphasizes the importance of staying vigilant and continuously questioning one’s motives and perceptions.\n\n• **The Danger of Becoming “Drunk on Emptiness”:** One of the more profound insights Adyashanti discusses is the tendency for individuals to become overly attached to the experience of emptiness or nothingness that can accompany spiritual awakening. He calls this being ""drunk on emptiness"" and warns that it can lead to detachment from life and emotional isolation. This theme is crucial as it highlights the necessity of integrating spiritual insight with real-world engagement, rather than withdrawing into a state of separation.\n\n• **The Trap of Meaninglessness and Embracing Life Fully:** Many who awaken may experience a sense of meaninglessness, as their old frameworks of understanding are dissolved. Adyashanti guides readers through this existential dilemma, helping them see beyond the illusion of meaninglessness and embrace life with renewed vigor. This theme encourages readers to find joy and meaning in the present moment, beyond conceptual beliefs.\n\n• **Radical Honesty and Continuous Self-Inquiry:** A central tenet of Adyashanti’s teachings is the need for sincere self-inquiry and radical honesty. Full awakening, he asserts, comes from questioning everything—every belief, every identity, and even the nature of the self itself. This theme highlights that enlightenment is not a one-time event but an ongoing process of deepening understanding and dismantling of the egoic structures that obscure reality.\n\n🕊️ **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders will gain invaluable insights into the often-unspoken challenges that arise after spiritual awakening. Adyashanti’s guidance offers both comfort and challenge, urging those on the path to confront the subtle ways in which the ego can re-emerge and co-opt enlightenment. By embracing radical honesty, continuous self-inquiry, and a deep engagement with life, readers will be better equipped to transition from fleeting moments of awakening to the full, abiding state of enlightenment.\n\n💌 **Your Experiences and Reflections:**\n\nHave you experienced moments of spiritual awakening that seemed to slip away?

He emphasizes that the journey to enlightenment begins by recognizing the limitations of the self and the illusions created by the ego. This foundational theme is meant to help seekers strip away the false layers of identity, leading them toward a state of pure consciousness.\n\n• **Orienting Ideas for Spiritual Practice:** The book introduces key ideas that help guide seekers on their spiritual path, focusing on concepts such as truth, liberation, and surrender.

This theme highlights the immediacy of awakening and the necessity of leaving behind all attachments to the self.\n\n• **Living Enlightenment in Daily Life:** The final aspect of Adyashanti’s teachings addresses the importance of embodying spiritual awakening in daily life.

Reddit,AMZN,"{'title': 'Neuroscience Wealth Strategy: A Review of Trading Beyond the Matrix by Van K. Tharp', 'content': 'In the world of trading and investing, it is often believed that success hinges on mastering the markets, following the right strategies, and making smart financial decisions. However, Van K. Tharp’s *Trading Beyond the Matrix: The Red Pill for Traders and Investors* offers a radical shift in perspective, suggesting that the most important factor in achieving financial success is self-transformation. This book transcends the typical analysis of market dynamics and instead delves deep into personal psychology, neuroscience, and the power of beliefs in shaping our financial outcomes.\n\n# The Core Premise: Transformation Through “Tharp Think”\n\nAt its core, *Trading Beyond the Matrix* is about changing one’s mindset to unlock wealth-building potential. Tharp presents what he calls ""Tharp Think,"" a series of principles derived from studying top traders\' behavior and beliefs. These principles go beyond traditional trading strategies, highlighting that it is not just about what traders know, but how they think and act. According to Tharp, the majority of traders fail because they are trapped by limiting beliefs—what he calls “the Matrix”—that cloud their decision-making and prevent them from seeing the market as it truly is.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the film *The Matrix*, Tharp explains that people are often programmed with destructive beliefs imposed by society, which leads to self-sabotage. These beliefs, deeply rooted in fear, greed, and unconscious biases, create a mental “Matrix” that distorts reality and hinders financial progress. By taking the metaphorical “red pill” and stepping out of this mental trap, individuals can achieve the clarity necessary for success. This, in essence, is the foundation of his neuroscience-based wealth strategy.\n\n[How to transform your trading results by transforming yourself](https://preview.redd.it/vt04rbz8ervd1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=64cd11c1b4293b02349b1f72f4ccc4dc3f10e857)\n\nCheck: [Trading Beyond the Matrix: The Red Pill for Traders and Investors](https://amzn.to/3Yy9qGv)\n\n# Neuroscience and the Psychology of Wealth\n\nTharp\'s approach aligns with modern understandings of neuroscience, particularly in how the brain processes fear and reward. The human brain is wired to avoid risk and seek comfort, but in the high-stakes world of trading, these instincts can lead to poor decisions. Neuroscience teaches that much of our behavior is driven by subconscious processes that can be reprogrammed through focused self-awareness and deliberate practice.\n\n*Trading Beyond the Matrix* emphasizes that wealth creation is largely a mental game. Tharp provides tools for traders to ""reprogram"" their minds, moving away from reactive patterns driven by fear and greed. This approach is not only effective in trading but also in any endeavor where the stakes are high, and emotional control is critical. By aligning one’s beliefs with a mindset of abundance and acceptance, traders can tap into their higher cognitive functions—what Tharp describes as trading from a state of joy and acceptance, rather than from fear and desperation.\n\n# The Neuroscience of Belief Systems: Reprogramming for Success\n\nOne of the central elements of the book is the exploration of belief systems and how they govern behavior. Tharp argues that successful traders are distinguished not by their technical knowledge of the markets, but by their ability to adopt empowering beliefs and discard those that no longer serve them. He likens this process to a form of self-transformation that can be achieved through various techniques, including mindfulness, affirmations, and neuro-linguistic programming (NLP).\n\nNeuroscience supports the idea that beliefs are not fixed and can be changed with deliberate effort. By repeatedly engaging in behaviors and thought patterns that align with success, individuals can create new neural pathways that support more productive and empowering financial behaviors. This concept of neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections—is a key component of Tharp’s strategy. The idea is that traders can ""rewire"" their brains for success by adopting the mindset of top traders and practicing it until it becomes second nature.\n\n# Transforming Wealth Strategy Through Consciousness\n\nTharp\'s wealth strategy is rooted in the idea that consciousness and self-awareness are critical to financial success. In one of the book’s key sections, he explains that many traders operate on a low level of consciousness, driven by reactive emotions like fear and greed. These emotional states activate the brain’s survival mechanisms, which can lead to impulsive and irrational decisions—exactly the kind of behavior that causes losses in the stock market.\n\nThe goal, according to Tharp, is to elevate one’s consciousness to higher levels where acceptance and joy replace fear and greed. At these levels, traders are able to remain calm and make more rational decisions, even in the face of market volatility. This ties into the concept of emotional regulation in neuroscience, where maintaining a balanced emotional state allows for better cognitive performance, particularly in high-pressure environments.\n\n# Practical Application: Real Transformations\n\nThe most powerful aspect of *Trading Beyond the Matrix* lies in the real-life stories of transformation that Tharp shares throughout the book. Each chapter focuses on a different individual who applied Tharp’s methods and experienced significant personal and financial breakthroughs. These stories serve as case studies, illustrating how the combination of self-awareness, belief transformation, and emotional regulation can lead to remarkable success.\n\nIn one example, a trader who had been struggling for years managed to completely turn his performance around by adopting Tharp Think and working on his limiting beliefs. The transformation wasn’t just in his financial success, but in his overall well-being and mindset. This practical application of neuroscience principles shows that success in the market is not just about mastering strategies, but mastering oneself.\n\n*Trading Beyond the Matrix* offers more than just trading advice—it provides a blueprint for personal transformation that leads to financial success. By tapping into the latest insights from neuroscience and psychology, Tharp teaches traders to reprogram their minds, elevating their consciousness and eliminating the limiting beliefs that keep them trapped in the Matrix. His wealth strategy is about mastering the inner game, which, once conquered, can lead to extraordinary results in the outer world of trading and beyond.\n\nFor those looking to improve not only their financial outcomes but also their overall mindset, this book is a powerful resource. It teaches that wealth begins within, and by transforming one’s mind, it is possible to achieve lasting success.\n\nRelated: [When is the subconscious mind most active?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Askfreedom_Jinn/comments/1g7ccvz/when_is_the_subconscious_mind_most_active/)\n\n**Related Important Suggestions:** \n\n>`Like the left-hand image shows, the center of our brains is “overheating”...`  \n  \n`Which comes from our bad luck and limiting beliefs.`  \n  \n`It’s the root wave of stress…`\n\n>`And if this wave gets too “hot” it can lead to dementia, strokes, even sudden heart problems…`  \n  \n`All it takes to quiet down this signal of stress is 9-Word Script…`  \n  \n`And they’re revealing these findings in a brand new video:` [`https://freedom-man-wind.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-wealth-signal.html`](https://freedom-man-wind.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-wealth-signal.html)  `- The number of people who have seen concrete proof of real miracles is remarkable.`'}"

It supports Dolby Atmos, which enhances the spatial audio experience, making it ideal for movies and music alike. The soundstage is expansive, with clear dialogue and rich bass.

Which sounds pretty cool.\n\nI've found tutorials to transfer using toner but I don't believe that's possible for thermal paper. And the only idea I had was to stick the photos down with PVA, then cover them with a clear varnish.\n\nI think I'd have to disassemble the desk/chair to do it that way but if that's what needed then I don't see it being an issue.\n\nSo if anyone knows a better way, or has any tips to do the above (never done it before so I'm not even sure if the varnish and glue is enough to keep the paper in place and protected properly), advice would be most welcome.""}"

Reddit,GOOGL,"{'title': 'I think I want to give up on college. ', 'content': 'I’m 21M and it doesn’t seem like I can do college right now. I’m pretty sure I just bombed my calculus midterm this past Friday, after bombing the first two. You can only replace 2 out of the 4, which means one from each half of the course. I’m a Junior in college and my gpa is 2.93 and I thought I was working towards getting my gpa back to 3.0 and my scholarship back ( scholarship gpa is 2.7 and I need a 3.0 ) but now I think I destroyed my chances. \n\nIt’s always this same cycle of not studying or taking notes and then cramming at the last minute. It makes me think I want to fail. Even though, my parents continued to pay for school after I lost my scholarship. I lost at the end of freshman year and they paid for the summer after freshman year and the entire sophomore year. They’re also paying for this first semester of junior year. I wish I could pay them the money back. I even said I could drop out and commit to working full time so I could pay them the money back. I just don’t think college is for me. It’s funny because at registration I sign up for classes and tell myself I’m going to do well this time. But then I repeat the same bullshit pattern of just showing up to class and not putting forth any effort to learn. I do go office hours and complete homework but that’s about it. And if it’s not something I can Google or use a calculator I usually do 75% to half because I end up not understanding how to do something and it’s too late to go to office hours. I’m always procrastinating. \n\n\nAnd it’s not like I’m blowing off school to party or do drugs ( nothing wrong with that, just making a point ). I pretty much do nothing all day. I spend 5-10 hours on social media: mostly reading stuff on Reddit or X. I usually read hours of threads going thru the comments. I don’t exercise or hang out with friends because I don’t really have any. Not blaming anyone but myself for that, just being upfront. I watch TV occasionally as I finished Bleach and I’m caught to TYBW and I’m always caught up on the One Piece manga save for Elbaf and Egghead for the anime. But I usually don’t watch TV. I basically wake up, go to class, come home, do homework if I have any, but no studying or anything. I’m just passively refusing to do anything to better myself in the future. I read up on something called hyperbolic discounting and it describes me pretty well. \n\n\n\nI’m an economics major and I can’t say I enjoy it nor do I hate it. Slowly I’ve really started to appreciate economics as a framework for modeling human behavior and identifying what motivated us albeit on specific circumstances that aren’t always applicable. This semester I have a class called Money & Capital Markets and the professor is old school, lecturing by mainly talking to us and writing equations and graphs on the board. I actually really enjoy going to office hours and look forward to it.We talk about economics but I also like to ask questions about his life: what brought him to economics, why he chose to teach at my school. He’s very open imo so he’ll go on tangents and we’ll get into other things. \n\n\nAdmittedly, perhaps this isn’t appropriate. I don’t really have a relationship with anyone outside of my immediate family. My dads side live in New York and my moms side lives in Ghana, West Africa. My aunt ( dad’s sister) lives in GA but she was very spiteful towards my mom when she immigrated here after marrying my dad so she doesn’t really visit often. My brothers and I go over to her house every so often. I’m saying all this to say I think one reason why I enjoy speaking with this professor so much is that I’ve never experienced having grandparents that I can talk to and receive wisdom from. I really appreciate it. I love my family dearly but they’re very religious so I don’t feel comfortable sharing my thoughts on certain things. For similar reasons, I don’t really open up with anyone at church. The professor is a deist so I feel more comfortable asking questions. His clsss is probably the class I’ve done the best in terms of engaging with the material. I’m not counting down the minutes and I’m starting to really get into the subject matter. \n\n\nI think I just need help figuring how to stop self sabotaging. I think I could do well in school if I put honest effort but I’m struggling to do that. It almost feel like I don’t want to get better. I’m not suicidal at all but I think I could be depressed. I feel like my heavy media consumption explains the ADD like symptoms. But I don’t want to self diagnose or anything because I understand that waters down the seriousness of people who are actually depressed and actually ADHD. I don’t even think I have good reason to be depressed. My parents take care of me and I know they love me. It just feels like I don’t want to put effort into my own life, even though I benefit from it ultimately in the long run. '}"

Reddit,GOOGL,"{'title': 'Modpost: Nyheder og opdateringer i r/Denmark', 'content': 'Hej, kære r/Denmark-fællesskab!\n\nVi har nogle spændende opdateringer og initiativer på tegnebrættet, og vi vil selvfølgelig gerne have jeres input! Så spids ørerne (eller øjnene i dette tilfælde), og lad os tage en tur gennem, hvad der er på vej.\n\n## 1. **Farvel og tak til Amalian – En uundværlig æra når sin afslutning**\n\nEfter hele **10 års trofast og dedikeret indsats** som topmod i r/Denmark er det nu tid for Amalian at tage en velfortjent pause. Det er svært at finde ord, der kan udtrykke den taknemmelighed og respekt, vi har for alt det, Amalian har gjort for fællesskabet. Fra små øjeblikke til store beslutninger har Amalian været en klippe, vi alle har kunnet støtte os til. \n\nVi kunne ikke have opnået det samme uden Amalians hjertevarme engagement og rolige vejledning, og selvom vi savner deres lederskab, glæder vi os over at have været en del af denne utrolige rejse sammen.\n\nAmalian har selv et par ord til jer, som vi med glæde vil dele:\n\n --- \n\n*Kære /r/Denmark* *Mange tak for de sidste 10år som moderator på /r/Denmark, de har på mange måder været begivenhedsrige og til tider småtossede. Min tid er desværre blevet for begrænset til at jeg kan støtte mod teams bag scenen og jeg vælger derfor at trække mig som topmod af /r/Denmark. Jeg håber oprigtigt at i vil støtte op om moderaterne og at i såfremt i er uenige i moderations-stilen at i selv tilbyder at stille op som moderatorer og deltager i moderator-demokratiet når det igen bliver muligt. Jeg vil stadig holde lidt øje med /r/Aarhus i ny og næ.* *So long, and thanks for all the fish!*\n\n ---\n\n**Vi siger TAK til Amalian** for det enorme arbejde og ønsker alt det bedste fremover! :star2:\n\n\n## 2. **Farvel og tak til liquid-handsoap – Han har nu vasket hænderne**\n\nEfter mange års dedikeret indsats har vores allesammens **liquid-handsoap** besluttet at træde tilbage som moderator. Vi er ikke sikre på, om det skyldes håndsæbe-mangel eller træthed af konstant at ""rense"" tråde, men én ting er sikkert: Hans aftryk (eller fingeraftryk) vil blive savnet.\n\nLiquid-handsoap har altid haft en humoristisk tilgang til de mest håbløse situationer, og han har med fast hånd (eller skal vi sige håndsæbe) styret vores debatkultur og sørget for, at vi alle kom ud af det med rene hænder.\n\nMen bare rolig! Liquid er ikke væk – han er stadig her som almindelig bruger. Vi er sikre på, at han fortsat vil finde tid til at give et par ""kloge"" kommentarer og holde os på tæerne, som kun han kan.\n\nEn lille forsmag på disse kloge ord:\n\n---\n\n*Jeg har modereret nok til at blive en legende, men ikke nok til at blive en meme :v: :pensive:*\n\n---\n\n**Vi siger TAK til liquid-handsoap** for hans indsats over årene – og for altid at holde r/Denmark ""rent""! :star2:\n\n## 3. **Reddit Meetup – Skal vi hænge ud IRL?**\nVi tænker… hvad med et **Reddit Meetup**? Lad os mødes i virkeligheden og se, om vi kan finde ud af, hvordan vi ser ud uden en skærm foran os! Men før vi går for meget i detaljer, vil vi lige lodde stemningen: **Er der interesse?**\n\nOg hvad siger I til **lokationen**? Skal vi holde det i Jylland, Fyn, Sjælland… eller måske på en af de 1417 andre øer, vi har liggende? :tada:\n\nDerudover er spørgsmålet: **Skal vi arrangere noget fancy**, eller vil I hellere bare mødes på en græsmark, se hinanden an og føle os lidt som “kældermennesker”? Vi er åbne for alle idéer, så fyr løs i kommentarerne!\n\n## 4. **Live Q&A på Discord – Skal vi snakke lidt?**\nVi overvejer også at afholde en **live Q&A-session på Discord**, hvor I kan stille spørgsmål til moderatorerne og høre, hvad der egentlig foregår bag kulisserne. Men før vi fastsætter en dato og tid, vil vi gerne høre fra jer: **Er der overhovedet interesse?**\n\nVi har nogle idéer til emner, som vi kunne tage op, men vi vil gerne høre, hvad I synes:\n- **Hvem er moderatorerne egentlig?** Hør de pinlige detaljer om, hvem vi er, og hvorfor vi gør, hvad vi gør.\n- **Regler – love it or hate it?** Vi gennemgår reglerne og tager en snak om, hvad der fungerer (eller ikke gør!).\n  - **Relevans i reglerne** – Hvordan sørger vi for, at de afspejler, hvad fællesskabet faktisk har brug for?\n  - **Tonen i debatten** – En hot topic! Foreslået af broder. Hvordan kan vi sikre, at vi ikke flår hovederne af hinanden under diskussionerne?\n- **Ordet Frit** – Her er jeres chance for at spørge om ALT! Er du nysgerrig på moderationen, reglerne eller noget helt tredje? Det er tid til at få svar!\n\nSå hvad siger I? Kom med jeres input i kommentarerne, og hvis I har idéer til andre emner, så tøv ikke med at dele dem!\n## 5. **Overskriftreglen – Skal vi snakke om det?**\nLad os tale om **Overskriftreglen**. Den har skabt lidt debat, så her er the deal: Den **forbyder ikke** brugen af originale overskrifter fra artikler. Men, og det er et stort men, **du skal læse overskriften** og vurdere, om den overholder vores regler om at være **beskrivende, faktuel og neutral**. Hvis den ikke gør det, skal du **skrive din egen overskrift**, der lever op til kravene. Sounds fair, right?\n\nMen nu vil vi gerne høre fra jer: **Fungerer reglen, som den er, eller er det tid til en justering?** Har I oplevet, at det skaber forvirring? Del jeres tanker og eksempler i kommentarerne!\n\n## 6. **Opdateringer i regelsættet – Læs dem, folkens!**\nVi har været i gang med at finjustere vores regelsæt, og **snart vil de nye regler være synlige i sidemenuen**. Det er altid en god idé at opdatere sig på reglerne – ikke fordi det er spændende læsning, men fordi det gør fællesskabet sjovere for os alle. :wink:\n\nSå tag et kig, når de er live, og vær klar til at kommentere. Vi har også shufflet lidt rundt på wikien, så det er det perfekte tidspunkt til at opdatere dig på hele molevitten!\n\n## 7. **Nu strammer vi op på debattonen i debatter om Israel/Palæstina**\n\nVi har også valgt at fjerne reglen L1 Israel/Palæstina. Reglen var tiltænkt som en midlertidig foranstaltning mod den meget hadske og eskalererende debat som emnet ofte afledte, hvilket gav et stort antal anmeldelser for personangreb, racisme og opfordring til vold - også blandt erfarne brugere der burde kende regelsættet. \n\nVi havde også håbet at reglen ville lette vores arbejde ved ikke at skulle behandle de afledte regelbrud, men da vi ikke indførte sanktionsmuligheder for reglen endte det blot med at de samme brugere fortsatte med at bryde reglen - og at vi brugte en masse tid på at fjerne indhold uden at brugerne rettede sig ind.\n\nVores overvejelser gik på om reglen skulle opgraderes på niveau med påmindelser om Debattone, så det blev noteret i modnoter og hvor gentagne brud på reglen ville svare til en enkelt påtale.\n\nVi har dog valgt at fjerne reglen og fokusere skarpere på de afledte regelbrud. Hold derfor gerne en god debattone når I debatterer emnet, og husk at undgå personangreb, racisme og opfordring til vold da sådanne regelbrud vil blive sanktioneret.\n## 8. **Eksempler på brugerrapporter**\nHer er et udpluk af de brugerrapporter, vi modtager. Husk, rapporter er en vigtig del af at holde r/Denmark kørende, men vi mods er også mennesker og gør vores bedste for at følge med.\n\n1. *""HESTENET""*\n2. *""Hvorfor fanden bruge lousy når ordet elendig eksisterer?""*\n3. *""Kan vi ha\' et forbud mod ragebait-artikler? Dette her er tydeligt skrevet som ragebait.""*\n4. *""Mystisk DF-opslag med nogle suspekte kommentarer, der lugter ret meget af bots.""*\n5. *""At snakke om borgerkrig, som værende bedre før end senere, virker ret slemt.""*\n6. *""Alderschauvinisme - skal det meldes som racisme og lignende?

Dette er vel en klar opfordring til debat? Jeg har selv fået en kommentar fjernet som refererer til Geneva-konventionen for at bevise at Israel har begået krigsforbrydelser. Så evidensførelse angående Israel krigsforbrydelser er ikke tilladt, men spørgsmål som beder om evidens og implicit antyder at man mener der findes evidens må gerne blive på subben? Husk at i selv har valgt at indføre denne særregel, så jeg mener jeg er i min ret til at kigge jeres moderation efter i sømmene.""*\n39. *""Hvordan opfordrer denne kommentar ikke til debat om konflikten? Det er et retorisk spørgsmål som antyder at kommentaren ikke mener at Israel begår folkemord i modstrid med FNs vurdering. Det er vel en opfordring til debat.""*\n40. *Direkte utvetydig folkedrabsbenægtelse. Kan I ikke lige melde ud hvis det nu er en nazisub, så jeg kan unsubscribe? Det ville være hjælp somt, tak!""*\n41. *Det er da synd for OP, men dette er et brevkasse spørgsmål som kun vedrører en enkelt persons problem, og som sådan ikke vedrører resten af danmark eller danskerne. Kan vi ikke snart få den linie i siger der er i jeres moderationer?*\n\n## 9. **Beskeder til mods – Husk, vi er også mennesker!**\nAt være moderator kan til tider være en udfordring. Vi vil gerne minde jer om, at vi også er mennesker, og tonen er vigtig. Her er nogle eksempler på beskeder, vi modtager som mods:\n\n**Eksempler på beskeder modteamet modtager (15 i alt):**\n\n1. *""Jeg ved hvor du bor.""*\n2. *""Ja fuck dig anmelder dig.""*\n3. *""Chikanesvin.""*\n4. *""SkibDen, du er da bare den største kujon... Jeg håber du nød dit lille magttrip, din klamme kujon.""*\n5. *""Du skal lade være med at kontakte mig, dit svin!""*\n6. *""Jeg voldtager dig.""*\n7. *""Fuck you.""*\n8. *""Håber dit hus brænder ned.""*\n9. *""Nederdrægtige, klamme voldsoffermobber.""*\n10. *""Mods, det kan gøres bedre.""*\n11. *""Er I alle idioter eller hva\'?""*\n12. *""I er virkelig de værste mods på Reddit...""*\n13. *""Hold kæft, hvor er du en p***** kujon, der bare sidder bag skærmen!""*\n14. *""Ja fuck dig.""*\n15. *""Så fuck da af, det er ikke dig jeg vil i kontakt med.""*\n16. *""I er virkelig de værste mods på reddit med den måde I kører den her sub, det er utroligt hvor out-of-touch I konstant er.*\n17. *Don\'t drink and mod.*\n18. *Er I alle idioter eller hva\'?*\n19. *Hvad laver jeres mods?*\n20. *Shitpost. Mods, det kan gøres bedre.*\n21. *Irrelevant pinned modpost*\n22. *I kan stikke jeres regler skråt op. Magtliderlige mennesker, der ingen magt har i det virkelig liv. Giv mig permanent bandlysning.*\n23. Fjols! Jeg håber du bliver til noget i dit næste liv.\n24. ""Hold nu kæft en masse ligegyldigt snot liquid-handsoap konstant skal udgyde. Prøv lige at få styr på jeres mod. Hvorfor svarer personen overhovedet til et indlæg omkring \'Slotsholmen på P1\' med \'Jeg hører det aldrig. Det er nok fordi det er et dårligt program\'. Hvis du ikke hører det, hvorfor så overhovedet svare. Og det bare konstant hver post efter post at der er bingo for liquid som kommer med en eller anden dumsmart kommentar.""\n\nUd over at være moderatorer, er vi også brugere på lige fod med alle andre. Når vi ikke har det grønne skjold ved vores brugernavn, deltager vi som almindelige brugere og kan også modtage påtaler ligesom jer. Vi har ret til vores personlige holdninger, når vi ikke har ""uniformen"" på. Uanset om du skriver til en moderator eller en anden bruger, så husk, at der altid sidder et menneske på den anden side af skærmen. Vi opfordrer jer til at behandle hinanden med respekt og ordentlighed, så vi sammen kan skabe et bedre og sundere miljø for alle på r/Denmark.\n\n## 10. **Farvel til ""Studietorsdag"" tematrådene**\nVi har valgt at lukke de ugentlige **Studietorsdag**-tråde, da de desværre ikke har været brugt ret meget. Fremadrettet henviser vi derfor (næsten) alle studie-relaterede diskussioner og spørgsmål til **r/DKstudie**, hvor I kan finde hjælp og vejledning fra andre studerende samt deltage i debatter om studierelevante emner.  \nDebatter om studie er stadig meget velkomne, så længe de overholder reglen om relevans for r/Denmark.\n\n---\nSå der har I det – masser af ting på vej! Vi glæder os til at høre jeres input, idéer og forslag. Lad os fortsætte med at gøre r/Denmark til et fantastisk sted!\n\n**Med venlig hilsen,**\n**Modteamet**'}"

Reddit,GOOGL,"{'title': 'Are Search Engines Purposely Hiding Certain Links?', 'content': 'I am NOT saying certain search engines like Google are definitely hiding or covering up information that they do not want certain people to see. But here\'s an analogy to illustrate my question:\n\nSay there\'s a library that holds books containing all human knowledge. You could find anything about everything in at least one of the books in this library. However, in order to check out a book, you must talk to one librarian. You tell the librarian what topic you\'d like to learn, and they will search the library\'s collection and return with a box of relevant books. Since all human knowledge contained in this library is guarded by the librarian, how do you know the librarian doesn\'t have malicious intent and is purposely excluding certain books from the box they give you? Can you be certain that the librarian doesn\'t want you to learn about a certain subject and thus is not giving you a certain book?  \n\n\nI hope you can understand my analogy. Obviously, not *all* of human knowledge is contained on the internet, but a huge amount is. But we access this information through a search engine like Google or Bing.

This error typically occurs when trying to run code that works fine with **cURL**, but fails within a **Node.js** environment. Such problems can be frustrating, especially for those new to **Vertex AI**.\n\nThe error message, which includes references to a DOCTYPE and invalid JSON, is often an indication that the response from the API is not in the expected format. This happens when HTML content is returned instead of the expected JSON response, making it difficult to process. In such cases, troubleshooting becomes essential.\n\nWhile the error might point to issues within the code, such as improper request handling, it is crucial to also investigate potential setup problems, particularly when using **Google Cloud CLI** on a local machine, like Windows. Even though the Vertex AI documentation offers sample code, slight differences in environment setup can cause inconsistencies.\n\nThis article dives into the specifics of this error and explores common troubleshooting steps. We will examine code snippets, explore the potential causes, and offer practical solutions for developers facing the DOCTYPE error in Vertex AI\'s generateContent function.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h0zooxa2ixvd1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d9a890e4c66ce4441095af5edc7d470b9aadf32\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Breaking Down the Vertex AI Script and Error Handling\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvvgswfyhxvd1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=960b890f8436122c9a1ddfa45c4109792a74f068\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe scripts provided earlier are designed to handle the process of generating content using **Google Cloud Vertex AI** in a Node.js environment. The main purpose of the script is to query the Vertex AI generative models, like ""gemini-1.0-pro"", by sending a user input and receiving the AI\'s response. However, when handling APIs, unexpected issues such as receiving HTML content instead of JSON can occur. This is where the critical methods and error-handling techniques come into play. The script ensures that the response is properly parsed into JSON format, preventing the ""**DOCTYPE** error"" issue mentioned.\n\nThe first solution focuses on error handling using the **try...catch** block. This ensures that if an error is encountered while calling the **generateContent** function, the script does not crash. Instead, the error is caught, and a meaningful message is logged to the console. This kind of robust error handling is especially important when dealing with external services like Google Cloud Vertex AI, where network issues or incorrect API responses may result in failures. Furthermore, the use of asynchronous functions ensures that the API call is properly handled without blocking other operations, which is essential for optimizing performance.\n\nAnother key element in the script is the use of **result.json()**, which is crucial for parsing the API\'s response into a usable format. The problem in this case arises because the API response is not always guaranteed to be in JSON format. By checking the **Content-Type** header, the second solution ensures that the response is actually in JSON format before attempting to parse it. This helps prevent the script from trying to parse an HTML error page (like the one in the DOCTYPE error) as JSON, which would lead to the ""Unexpected token \'<\'"" error.\n\nIn the third solution, the focus shifts to testing. Here, **unit tests** are implemented using the Mocha and Chai libraries. Unit testing is a critical step in ensuring that the code behaves as expected across different environments and scenarios. By stubbing the API calls, the tests can simulate various responses from the Vertex AI service, allowing developers to verify that the code can handle both success and error cases properly. This approach ensures that the final product is more resilient and reliable, as it has been tested for a range of possible outcomes.\n\n### Resolving Vertex AI generateContent Error: Different Approaches in Node.js\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/loe5hs0zhxvd1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5addb3596c0163c0348571c9c51f33476a62d24f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing Node.js with Google Cloud Vertex AI SDK for content generation\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0z3x6s2ixvd1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=36ce5a91616c0f879deb3f97b39d5b85ef7ec007\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    // Solution 1: Handling Unexpected HTML Response with Correct Fetching\n    const { VertexAI } = require(\'@google-cloud/vertexai\');\n    const vertexAI = new VertexAI({ project: \'your-project-id\', location: \'your-location\' });\n    const model = vertexAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \'gemini-1.0-pro\' });\n    async function run(command) {\n    try {\n    const result = await model.generateContent({ contents: [{ role: \'user\', parts: command }] });\n    const jsonResponse = await result.json();\n       console.log(jsonResponse);\n    } catch (error) {\n       console.error(\'Error processing response:\', error.message);\n    }\n    }\n    run(""What is the capital of India?"");\n\n### Improving Error Handling and Adding Content-Type Validation\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xxdmmqlzhxvd1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4625ba634d335922fa7e93859c7ddfb794f2a19a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNode.js: Validating Response and Handling Non-JSON Responses\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ja4pf53ixvd1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=95b1b192108bac152fe10dc59d42e2d5a4035a14\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    // Solution 2: Checking Content-Type Header to Ensure JSON\n    const { VertexAI } = require(\'@google-cloud/vertexai\');\n    const vertexAI = new VertexAI({ project: \'your-project-id\', location: \'your-location\' });\n    const model = vertexAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \'gemini-1.0-pro\' });\n    async function run(command) {\n    try {\n    const result = await model.generateContent({ contents: [{ role: \'user\', parts: command }] });\n    if (result.headers.get(\'content-type\').includes(\'application/json\')) {\n    const jsonResponse = await result.json();\n         console.log(jsonResponse);\n    } else {\n         console.error(\'Unexpected response format:\', result.headers.get(\'content-type\'));\n    }\n    } catch (error) {\n       console.error(\'Error fetching content:\', error.message);\n    }\n    }\n    run(""What is the capital of India?"");\n\n### Adding Unit Tests to Validate JSON Parsing and Error Handling\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6k1onr60ixvd1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23722bea7f48487d059952841125546d1a5604af\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNode.js: Testing with Mocha and Chai for Valid JSON Responses\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5d3e8wi3ixvd1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f50000f65f7e121dbc0ebca528d0079197431f4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    // Solution 3: Writing Unit Tests for Vertex AI with Mocha and Chai\n    const chai = require(\'chai\');\n    const { expect } = chai;\n    const sinon = require(\'sinon\');\n    const { VertexAI } = require(\'@google-cloud/vertexai\');\n    describe(\'Vertex AI Generate Content\', () => {\n    it(\'should return valid JSON content\', async () => {\n    const vertexAI = new VertexAI({ project: \'test-project\', location: \'test-location\' });\n    const model = vertexAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \'gemini-1.0-pro\' });\n    const stub = sinon.stub(model, \'generateContent\').returns(Promise.resolve({\n    json: () => ({ response: \'New Delhi\' }),\n    headers: { get: () => \'application/json\' }\n    }));\n    const result = await model.generateContent(\'What is the capital of India?\');\n    const jsonResponse = await result.json();\n    expect(jsonResponse.response).to.equal(\'New Delhi\');\n       stub.restore();\n    });\n    });\n\n### Understanding Vertex AI Response Issues in Node.js\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qczpgtr0ixvd1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbba49cd423e08e7e344934d7c459c66923c327f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen working with **Google Cloud Vertex AI** in Node.js, a key aspect to consider is how data is exchanged between the API and the application. One common issue, as seen in this scenario, is receiving an unexpected HTML response instead of the expected JSON format. This can lead to syntax errors, such as ""Unexpected token DOCTYPE,"" which occur because the code tries to parse HTML as if it were JSON. The root cause is usually a misconfigured request, an incorrect API endpoint, or a problem with authentication.\n\nAdditionally, it’s important to remember that **Node.js** operates differently than command-line tools like **cURL**. While cURL directly interacts with the API over HTTP, Node.js makes use of packages like the Google Cloud SDK. These libraries add layers of abstraction, meaning extra error handling and validation are necessary to ensure proper data exchange. Setting up headers correctly, especially the ""Content-Type"" for both requests and responses, is critical for handling API calls smoothly.\n\nAnother factor that could lead to errors is network configuration or local environment settings. When running the Vertex AI SDK on a local machine, the CLI environment might behave differently than a cloud-based environment. Issues like local proxy settings, firewall configurations, or missing environment variables may affect the response from Vertex AI. Thus, developers should ensure that their local environment mimics the cloud environment as closely as possible to avoid inconsistencies when switching between them.\n\n#### Common Questions About Vertex AI DOCTYPE Errors in Node.js\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcw8ysc1ixvd1.jpg?width=1155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f4a19b4580e6e016296800cda59b58cefdf2afb\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat causes the ""DOCTYPE"" error in Vertex AI responses?\n\nThe ""DOCTYPE"" error occurs when the API returns an HTML response instead of the expected JSON format. This often happens due to incorrect API calls, improper endpoints, or authentication issues.\n\nHow can I avoid HTML responses in Node.js when using Vertex AI?\n\nEnsure that you are making API requests to the correct endpoint, and always validate the response headers. Use **result.headers.get(\'content-type\')** to check if the response is JSON before parsing it.\n\nWhy does my cURL command work but not my Node.js script?\n\ncURL interacts directly with the API using HTTP, while Node.js uses additional libraries, such as the Google Cloud SDK. Ensure the SDK is correctly configured and handling authentication and request formatting properly.\n\nHow can I handle unexpected responses in my Node.js application?\n\nUse **try...catch** blocks in asynchronous functions to catch errors and implement checks for the **Content-Type** header to avoid parsing errors from unexpected HTML responses.\n\nHow can I test my Vertex AI Node.js code locally?\n\nYou can simulate API responses using libraries like **sinon.stub** to create test cases and use **Mocha** and **Chai** to write unit tests. This ensures your code behaves as expected in different environments.\n\n#### Final Thoughts on Troubleshooting Vertex AI Errors\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o55yrux1ixvd1.jpg?width=1155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e2d05aee3b450c6efac71d608d1f9db29910a4d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDealing with ""Unexpected token DOCTYPE"" errors in Vertex AI usually indicates a response format issue. Checking the API configuration and ensuring the correct content type is returned can help prevent such issues. Proper error handling is key to solving this problem.\n\nBy addressing these issues, developers can avoid JSON parsing errors and ensure smooth interaction with Google Cloud\'s AI services. Using appropriate validation, testing, and troubleshooting techniques guarantees robust and reliable application performance.\n\n###### Sources and References for Vertex AI Error Resolution\n\nInformation on the Vertex AI SDK and its documentation can be found on the official Google Cloud documentation page.

However, with that said, they are pretty ""homemade"" and thus far have used a local recording studio, and the same guy records, mixes and masters their tracks.\n\nTheir first album turned out great, the second one was ok, but they have just recorded a 3rd, and it just doesn\'t sound right. The instruments are all well done by professional musicians, and the mix on them seems fine if not fantastic, but their voices in the mix just aren\'t right.\n\nThe studio guy who did everything is quite touchy and takes offence if they aren\'t happy with the final product or want changes. However they\'ve invested a lot in the recording process, and in order to build on their following etc., this album needs to be professional quality.\n\nSo with all that said, I have some questions on their behalf:\n\n1. How does one know if what a track/tracks need is to be mixed, mastered, or both?\n\n2. What is the best way to find the right person for the job?

These actions, coupled with Musk's promotion of right-wing ideologies and misinformation on Twitter, have contributed to a more polarized online environment and raised concerns about the undue influence of wealthy individuals on political narratives. \n* **Peter Thiel's backing of JD Vance:** Thiel, a prominent venture capitalist, has heavily funded Vance's political career, despite Vance's anti-LGBTQ+ stance, contrasting with Thiel's own sexual orientation. This example highlights how billionaires can use their wealth to elevate politicians who align with their interests, regardless of the politician's stance on issues that might directly affect the billionaire. \n* **Cryptocurrency platforms and fake support for Trump:** Some sources allege that cryptocurrency platforms, particularly one backed by Peter Thiel, have been exploited to create a false impression of strong public support for Trump. Commenters suggest that this manipulation is intended to influence public perception and potentially sway elections.\n* **Texas courts and corporate bias:** Sources suggest that Musk's choice of Texas courts for legal proceedings related to Twitter highlights a perceived conservative bias within the Texan legal system, favorable to corporations and conservative ideologies. This situation, seen as a strategic maneuver by Musk, points to how billionaires can exploit legal systems for their advantage.\n\n**Manipulation of the Left:**\n\n* **Limited information about left-wing manipulation:** While the sources extensively detail billionaire influence on the right, they provide limited information about similar manipulation on the left. \n* **George Soros as a counter-example:** Some commenters point to George Soros as a potential counter-example of a billionaire influencing the left. However, this comparison is deemed inadequate by other users, and the sources lack specific details on how Soros might be manipulating the left.\n* **Potential for manipulation through media and technology:**  The sources illustrate how billionaires can exert influence through media ownership and control over technology platforms. These avenues of manipulation, while predominantly used by right-leaning billionaires in the examples provided, could theoretically be used to manipulate individuals on the left as well.\n\nIt's important to note that the sources are primarily Reddit discussions, potentially representing a limited viewpoint.  More comprehensive research from diverse sources is necessary to understand the full extent of billionaires' manipulation on both sides of the political spectrum in America. \n\n\nDamn 👀 (27:56)\n\nhttps://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/ebe54b72-cc9b-4d73-a241-76921b4f5331/audio""}"

I contacted CBT therapist about 9 months ago, I came with only 2 problems: sleeping issues (going sleep very late, like 4-5am, sometimes even in the morning, like 8-9am) and problems with maintaining meaningful relations, which also led to many impulsive sexual behaviors, which I also wanted to stop. I was very successful work wise, I had many friends, some self confidence issues but I masked it well with all my work successes. My therapist suggested that I might have ADHD, but at this moment I was like: yeah, whetever, I might have it, I might not have it, what does it change? I feel well and I don\'t feel I need to be medicated, so why would we even bother? But she told me that we NEED TO diagnose it before we start CBT program.\n\nI left my country to work online in South East Asia. I was there for a month with my friend and then he left. I was there completely alone, for the first time in my life I had no one around me. I thought it\'s gonna be a nice experience, because I traveled a lot for like last 10 years with other ppl. And since I had so much time, I decided to resume my therapy. We started to diagnose ADHD, it came out it\'s ""probably positive"". In the meantime my grandma went to the hospital and I had a little emotional crisis. I cried for the first time in probably 10+ years, but after few hours I was completely fine, I shut off my emotions like I always did. After a week I had my first anxiety/panic attack, but I just thought it was because of the coffee I drunk on the empty stomach. Week later I had anxiety/panic attack again, it also happened with coffee on empty stomach, also it happened after eating in the same restaurant. I told my therapist about attacks and she was like: yeah yeah it looks like a panic attack, don\'t be afraid, they always pass and you will be fine. She kinda said it like it was completely normal thing for an adult person.\n\nWhen we finished ADHD diagnose. She was like: ""oh we have to check one more thing"", but she didn\'t want to tell me what. We made tests. By the questions I got, I was sure we are diagnosing depression. We finished the diagnose and she was like: ""it came negative! Do you know what did we check? BPD! But it\'s all fine, you don\'t need to worry, it\'s negative. I had to check it because BPD and ADHD are very similar, so I had to make sure"". And when I heard that ADHD and BPD are similar I just got crazy about wtf is ADHD then. I focused on all the negative sides of ADHD, I started to find all these attributes in myself. Just imagine, I am completely alone 15k km from my home, I just had the worst time of my life, first panic attacks, my grandma is in hospital, I am thinking only about how bad grandson I am because I didn\'t visit her in a long time. And then the only person I am talking to regularly secretly made BPD tests on me.\n\nThat was the moment when my life turned upside down. The last month I stayed in Asia was the worst time of my life. My body was extremely tense because of the anxiety. I was completely alone there, just me and my computer connected to the internet. All I did was googling what is ADHD, what is wrong with this. I started to realized how weird I am. I always thought I am different but in like a good way, I liked to be different and my whole life was a proof that I am right and everyone else is wrong. Everything I liked about myself just got ruined in one moment. The anxiety was so huge that I couldn\'t sleep. I had small derealization episodes. I was even afraid to go back home, even tho I made like 50+ flights in my life.\n\nWhen I came back to my hometown, I started to visit my therapists again. All she was saying was: Don\'t worry, it\'s gonna be better, it\'s normal to feel worse when starting therapy bla bla bla. I continued therapy for another 6 months. Last month, she came back from 1 month vacation. After resuming therapy my anxiety got so bad that I had to take take Xanax, after 2 weeks of taking Xanax I got prescribed mirtazapine.\n\nMy life is one huge mess right now, I have huge General Anxiety Disorder and I have no idea how to cope with it. I don\'t think I ever had anxiety attacks before that trip, and now I am waking up and I ""feel weird"" 24/7. I feel like my body is so tense. I can\'t focus on anything, 95% of my thoughts are negative. I tried mindfullness and relaxation techniques, but it\'s almost impossible to me for stay still for a longer period. I wasn\'t like that. I had small ""depression"" episodes before, but I wouldn\'t even call it a real depression. But now I just don\'t know who I am anymore, who should I be, I am afraid to travel again, I am even afraid to go out from my home very often. I am afraid about my physical health, my mental health, my family. I felt like I had everything under my control before that trip and now I lost it all. That\'s such a weird feeling. I am also thinking about these derealzation episodes a lot and I always look around and ask myself ""is it happening to me again?"". I finally decided to leave my CBT therapist and went to psychodynamic guy. I am also afraid about opening to him as well. I just feel lost and hopeless. Can you give me any tips guys?'}"

If it helps, I have State Farm insurance in GA\n\n2. What could have been a probable cause of this? I genuinely don\'t understand how I could have scratched the car, even to this extent.. If someone mentions I got my car keyed, I highly doubt it (I\'m not excluding it, but I\'m not a jackass when I drive, I park properly, I don\'t cut people off, I don\'t road rage, etc.)\n\n3.

Reddit,GOOGL,"{'title': 'Dick Bomb', 'content': 'This story occurred while I was a Special Forces candidate. I was in holdover, waiting to begin the Q-course after selection, when I decided that I was going to get jacked. So I asked a guy named Ken, who I’d gone to basic training with, about roids. He’d always denied juicing, claimed to be natty, but I knew that there was no way this guy was able to recover from three workouts a day plus smoke sessions and PT and still be huge. Sure enough, over some beers, he admitted to “lightly using”; I pressed him for more details and asked for a point of contact. He obliged. He gave me the phone number of some guy, who in turn, gave me another guy’s number. A chain of plausible deniability, I guess. I texted the guy.\n\n“Hey Wayne, my name is Joe. This guy Ken gave me Rico’s number who gave me your number. I’m looking for some product.”\n\n“What kind you want?”\n\n“I don’t know, just trying to get jacked.”\n\n“Alright, I’d recommend running some test and some TREN. I’ll give you some stuff for a PCT afterward and a special bonus. Give you 10 weeks worth for $250.”\n\n“Sounds good. When and where can I pick up?” I texted.\n\nI really had no idea what I was doing and decided to just trust the guy. I Googled some of the compounds he’d referred to and learned that Trenbolone is an anabolic agent originally designed to beef up meat cattle. Perfect, I thought. Before I knew it, I was driving to meet this random guy at a gas station towards Raleigh.\n\n\n\nAt the gas station, I spotted a shitty, dented Honda Element that matched the description the guy had given me. He was parked next to the vacuum station, far away from the pumps and the convenience store. I pulled my vehicle in behind his, making it look like I was waiting to use the vacuum myself. I got out of my vehicle and spotted a short, jacked dude in a hoodie.\n\n“Hey, are you Wayne?” I said. The short, jacked dude with a thick beard looked at me with a sideways glance.\n\n“You here for the gear?” he said. His lack of subtly worried me, but I still appreciated his rhyme. This was obviously a legit businessman.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe motioned for me to come over towards the passenger door facing away from the gas station. In the back he had a shoebox filled with a bunch of needles, vials, and pills. “Alright my dude, so this here is TREN.” He picked up an unmarked vial with a brackish orange fluid inside of it. “You’ll want to do about one milliliter twice a week. It should be about 250 milligrams a milliliter… And FYI, these have a little bit of a bite to them…”\n\n“What do you mean bite?”\n\n“They sting a bit, but you’ll get used to it,” Wayne said, which instantly assuaged my nerves. Wayne was jacked. I had nothing to fear. Wayne picked up another unmarked vial, this one with a much clearer fluid inside.\n\n“This here is your test; again, you’re gonna want to shoot this up twice a week, one milliliter. It should be about 250 milligrams per milliliter.” Wayne put the vials back and pulled out a bag full of little white pills. “These are your PCT, the big ones are Clomid, and the small ones are Nolvadex. Two weeks after your last injection, you’re gonna want to start off by taking two of each per day for one week. Then take one of each per day until you are out of pills. This should get your testicles back up and running.” Wayne put the bag back into the shoe box.\n\nGet my testicles back up and running? Maybe I hadn’t thought this through completely. I had to decide quickly.\n\n“Are these all coming from a pharmacy? What’s your source?” I asked, feeling like a very savvy consumer for having asked such a question.\n\nWayne shook his head. “The pills are prescribed—pulled them from my personal prescription. The others though, I cooked up myself.” Wayne said.\n\n“Oh… are you like a chemist or something?” I asked, stupidly.\n\n“No, I just watch a lot of YouTube and read a lot of Reddit. Ordered the raw chemicals from China and mixed them in my garage,” Wayne said nonchalantly, giving me a slight shrug of his shoulders as if to say it was no big deal.\n\n“And this is what you use?”\n\n“Oh yeah,” Wayne said. If it’s good enough for Wayne, it’s good enough for Joe. Wayne reached back into the shoe box and procured a Ziplock bag full of giant red and white-looking horse pills. A big smile came across Wayne’s face.\n\n“You’re gonna love these, my dude. These here are a special concoction of my own design. They each contain 100mg of Viagra, 100mg of Cialis, and 300mg of caffeine. You will fuck like a machine and get a sick pump. I call them Dick Bombs.” Wayne chuckled. He handed me the bag, which to me glowed like the Ark of the Covenant. I beheld these wonders of medical engineering, and in an instant, all of my doubts and concerns about Wayne’s products dissipated.\n\n“Wayne, you deserve a Nobel prize,” I said.\n\n“Hahaha, yeah, you’re gonna love ‘em, bro. Anyways my dude, good meeting you. If you need anything from me, feel free to hit me up,” Wayne said, handing me the box. After giving him my payment, he gave me a vigorous shake with his meaty hand and sped off in his piece-of-shit Honda. I drove home, feeling like a new era had begun in the life of Joe, already daydreaming about the jacked sex god that I would become.\n\n\n\nUpon return to the barracks, I found a place to stash the roids, where I figured the SF cadre would never look. I quickly got on Google and began to research how to properly cycle the compounds I had been given. Luckily the internet is chock full of forums, where various individuals discuss their cycles and how they went. Interestingly, in many of these forums, along with the username and comment, they also list body measurements along with a picture of the commentator. I sifted through lots of advice with no idea how to discern good from bad, until I decided that I would simply listen to the guys with the biggest bicep measurements. From my “research” I determined that Wayne’s prescribed cycle wasn’t particularly crazy or anything.\n\n\n\nThe next night I decided it was time to do it. I pulled up a YouTube video of a guy demoing how to inject steroids into the quadriceps. I chose the quadriceps because it seemed like it would be easier to put the needle in the right place, and it wouldn’t require awkwardly twisting around, as it would if I were to inject into my ass.\n\nFeeling very nervous, I set about sterilizing the injection site, and loading up a syringe. I’d read that you could inject as much as two milliliters in any one injection, and that you could load both compounds into a single syringe. So I took the needle, inserted it into the vial of testosterone, and very slowly and painfully drew up the fluid with the 26-gauge needle. This took forever, and I wondered if I was doing it wrong, until at long last it hit the one milliliter mark. I then took the same needle stuck it into the bottle of TREN, and drew the rusty liquid into the syringe. This fluid was thick and flowed more slowly.\n\nFinally, I had two milliliters loaded up with steroids. I cleared the syringe of excess air as I learned from YouTube. Then I rewatched the video to ensure that I was targeting the correct portion of my quad. I positioned the 1.5-inch needle above the spot, like the killer in a slasher film, at a ninety-degree angle. I took a deep inhale. Sweat had beaded on my forehead as I pushed the needle towards my leg. The needle shook in the air; my hand trembled like I was having a fucking seizure. I felt like I suddenly had cerebral palsy. My head was feeling light. *Maybe I should back out of this before something bad happens,* I thought. *Don’t be a fucking bitch,* another part of me responded. And I shakily drove that needle into my leg.\n\nAt first the skin indented; the needle didn’t puncture. It turns out I had probably dulled it after inserting it into two different vials. I pushed a bit harder and punctured the skin, driving it fully into my quad. Nausea hit me immediately, and I thought I might pass out. Then my quad spasmed, like I had hit a nerve or something, but there was no blood or anything. I depressed the plunger and felt the two milliliters of fluid slowly pump into my quadriceps. It was a warm sensation at first, followed by a mild burning feeling. Wayne did say it would have a bit of “bite.” Despite this, I fully depressed the plunger and pumped it all in, then shakily withdrew the needle. I did it quickly because I feared snapping off the needle beneath the skin, which would’ve made a very awkward trip to the ER. After disposing the needle, I sat back and tried to catch my breath. I felt sweaty and ill but was relieved to have survived the experience. And it would all be worth it. I would look back and laugh at this after I’d become a jacked sex god.\n\n\n\nThe next day, I awoke, and felt a sharp pain in my quad where I injected. I looked at the site and saw that it had grown red and inflamed. I stood up out of my bed and instantly my right leg buckled. A hot pain radiated up and down my quad emanating from the injection site. *Fuck fuck fuck,* I thought. I hobbled over to the bathroom to get a better look at it. I for sure had a knot in my quad and it hurt like a motherfucker. I did some Googling, and it seemed unlikely that an infection could’ve taken hold this fast, which was my chief concern. It was six in the morning when I began to text and call Wayne repeatedly.\n\n“Helllooooo?”\n\n“Wayne, its Joe, from yesterday. I injected some into my quad, and now I’ve got a huge knot in my quad that’s a bit red, and I can’t fucking walk,” I said.\n\n“Oh yeah, bro, like I said, it’s got a bit of bite to it,” Wayne said.\n\n“A bit of bite? This shit hurts real bad, dude,” I said.\n\n“Yeah, well, the quad is sensitive, and your body just needs to get used to it.”\n\n“You’re sure it’s not an infection or something?”\n\n“Nah, just give it a couple of days, bro, and inject it into your ass next time. Later, dude.” Wayne hung up on me.\n\n“Fuck.” I thought that Wayne seemed pretty confident. Then I remembered that Wayne is jacked, and I hoped that I hadn’t just sounded like a little bitch. So I decided not to worry about it. I’d keep an eye on it and just tough it out for a few days.\n\n\n\nI hobbled for about a week. I told everyone that I’d just twisted my ankle, which miraculously got me out of some PT. I carried on injecting the vile mixture, trying various other spots after attempting my ass, which I found caused both of my ass cheeks to hurt so bad that I couldn’t sit comfortably. After this I attempted my shoulders, which had the unfortunate side effect of rendering me unable to lift my arm. *I’ll get used to it,* I thought.\n\nIt turns out that Wayne was full of shit. After several weeks, I wasn’t getting used to it all. I was just in pain, sweaty, and murderously horny. Let me tell you, if I wasn’t engaged in cadre organized bullshit, I was swiping right on Tinder like it was my full-time job.\n\n\n\nI was on a date with this blonde bimbo in Raleigh. It seemed to be going pretty well. We’d just finished dinner and we were about to head back to her place. I snuck off into the bathroom and fished inside of my pocket until I grasped one of the Dick Bombs that Wayne had given me. The huge red and white homemade pill shone with the promise of a wild night. I downed it, then returned to my date and began to drive us back to her place.\n\nOn the drive back she pats my thigh, a promising sign. Fifteen minutes into the drive, I begin to get a head rush—must be the caffeine. Shortly thereafter, I began to feel a little congested, like my nose was constricting. Then I developed a pounding headache and a rock-hard erection, and my heart began to pound. I thought I might be about to have a heart attack, but I played cool, not wanting to ruin my chances with bimbo.\n\n\n\nWe arrived at her place and she invited me inside. She pulled me into a bedroom that did not have a bed. We made out. We were on the floor, my pants were down, but underwear was on, and she was in the same configuration. She was straddling on top of me, grinding her panty-covered pussy against my dick, and making out with me like her life depended on it.\n\nThings seemed to be going well. I felt like my cock was about to tear through my underwear and through her panties, so I began to remove them. She stopped me.\n\n“Not on a first date buddy,” she said, then continued to make out with me. My headache had not dissipated, and my cock was so hard I worried that I was going to rupture a vein—I hoped she was at least impressed by it. I tried not to think about it or panic, and proceeded to make out with her for quite some time.\n\nShe didn’t want me to go, and in fact I’m quite sure she would’ve made out with me all night, but I’m not in high school. I was pretty certain that if I didn’t cum soon, that my dick might actually explode. I went back to my barracks and rubbed one out.\n\nOnce I was done, my dick was still hard. I laid on my side with my dick erect and rigid like a fucking kickstand all night.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, I woke up with the most epic morning wood of my life. I see that I have a text on my phone.\n\n“You should head on over and have breakfast at my place. I look forward to our second date ;)” the bimbo texted me.\n\n“I’ll head on over,” I responded.\n\nI grabbed an overnight bag and reached for the Dick Bombs in my drawer. I studied the red and white pill, and wondered whether it would be wise to consume another one. This chick was going to be voracious—I knew that I would get laid. She was like a high-school-girl-at-prom kind of horny. Wisely, I knocked back another pill and washed it down with a full bottle of Gatorade. I now had somewhere around 200mg of Viagra, 200mg of Cialis, and somewhere between 350 to 600mg of caffeine pumping through my veins. Oh, and of course the Trenbolone.\n\n\n\nTurns out, the bitch was a liar. There was no breakfast; I got mauled by a girl in lingerie as soon as I crossed the threshold. I carried her to the room, ripped off her panties, which were already wet, condomed up, and thrust into her. My head was throbbing. I could feel my heart beat in my eyes, face, and cock, which literally jumped with each pulsation. I was full of energy and still horny from last night. We started hard. She was squirting all over me, making a fucking mess of the bed. She came, I came. She was delighted to see I was still hard and began blowing me, though she really didn’t need to, then slid me inside her again.\n\nMy cock was so hard that it was tearing through condoms. She orgasmed as my high velocity nut smacked into her uterus. She was loving it and fucking insatiable. Five times in a row we went, without stopping, and I was still hard.\n\n\n\nI could no longer tell if my cock was hurting from the rough sex or from the copious amounts of drugs pumping through my system. Either way, I felt fairly certain that I was facing a medical emergency and needed to do something about it. I did notice that the pain seemed to abate after I came, so I decided that I just needed to keep cumming.\n\nShe had gone to the kitchen to rehydrate. I came up behind her and grabbed her by the hair, she hurriedly hiked down her pants, and I bent her over and fucked her again.\n\nPussy juice and cum dribbled onto the floor, and I was beginning to lose my footing. We fucked again on the table, then the couch, the bed two more times, she stopped to take some Motrin, then we did it some more, standing, laying, kneeling, acrobatic fucking. I was giving her everything I had, and she was enduring it, somehow. She was an insatiable sex fiend. I had to slay her.\n\nWe’d quiver, cum, and collapse, only for her to crawl towards me like some heroin addict saying “again.” Again, we’d got to the point where it became just as much about defeating her as it was about relieving my never-ending erection.\n\nWhen all was said and done, we fucked well north of twenty times in a twenty-four-hour period. She laid on her side in ecstatic pain, clutching her abdomen and icing her pussy. I had conquered her. I’d slain my Grendel.\n\nUnfortunately, she was decommissioned for a little over a week, bleeding and sore as shit, and her stomach hurt. The poor girl had to call in sick from work for the week. The rest of our short time together was quite lame.\n\nI’d survived the experience, even though I’d overdosed on Dick Bomb. I did have a pretty wicked nose bleed that lasted a couple of days, and my body was still fucking hurting from all the bullshit juice Wayne had given me.\n\nEven with all that, I felt like an absolute stud, and pitied whatever poor fucking sap dated her next.\n\n\n\n\xa0To read more check out ""Department Of Degenerates"" by Specialist Joe.

I hope you’re all doing well, and if it’s a lil tough for you I sincerely hope it improves! \n\nToday, I’m looking for somebody to play a canon female character from the world of My Hero Academia against a male original character of my own! More specifically some characters I’m looking for are as follows from most to least interested; Momo Yaoyorozu, Nejire Hado, Rumi Usagiyama/Mirko, Kyoka Jiro, or Mina Ashido! If you have anyone else you want to play as though that would be fine by me, those are just my preferences. If you can play a female canon character for me, then I’d be happy to play any male canon character for you! However I will NOT play canon ships, sorry. \nI also might be down to do some OC/OC pairings depending on who your character is and if I think they’d mesh well with mine, though canon is preferred. \n\nFor the story and plot itself, I’m not picky at all. I’m very open to any ideas or whatever preferences you have as long as romance is an integral part of the story. I’m also open to atypical kinds of romance like on-again-off-again, love triangles, etc. I would love to hear your ideas and thoughts, it makes everything more fun! Usually I like to have some form of action involved, with a main villain and such, but we can discuss and come up with something together! \n\nGenerally what I look for in a roleplay partner is somebody I can converse with. I love talking about our characters and the story and all that, especially their interactions. Fleshing characters out and creating complex dynamics and all of that is probably my favorite thing about roleplay, I find it extremely gratifying to have our own unique story to tell. So if you’re the kinda person who likes chatting about the story OOC, then I think we’ll get along beautifully. Creativity and flexibility are huge for me, because I love it when you guys bring your own ideas and twists to spice it all up. Unorthodox characters and stuff are my JAM, I love weird ideas and unusual characters. \nBut above all else I value honesty. If you don’t like how I’m playing a canon character for you, please tell me. If you don’t like one of my OCs, please tell me. If you just aren’t into the roleplay, please tell me. We can always figure it out. At the end of the day this is purely entertainment, and if you aren’t being entertained then I want to fix that! \n\nIn terms of writing ability and such, I’m not super picky. What I ask of you is that you can consistently do 2-3 paragraphs per response, be decently detailed, and have good grammar. You can probably guess by my writing here, I’m not a stickler with grammar but it can definitely make or break a story. Personally I tend to attempt to write 2-3 paragraphs per response, mostly depending on what’s required. 1 paragraph is fine too, as long as it’s moving the story forward! \n\nI’ll warn you now, however, that I tend to get busy pretty easily between work and friends and other stuff. But I always try to crank out a few responses a day, and if I don’t think I can do that then I’ll give you a heads up to the best of my ability! Another slight warning is that I like to work my characters a little differently compared to what I’ve seen from other people. Most people like to precreate character profiles and get them written out in a Google doc or something along those lines, and no hate for that, it’s a perfectly valid method that works for tons of people. Personally, though, I find that restricting and even a little aggravating at times because of how rigid it feels to me. Instead, I have multiple ideas for characters just sort of floating around in my head. Once we start creating the plot I start changing up those ideas to fit with what we have, and once it’s all set up I write up a profile in the moment! I feel like I’m not describing it very well but you’ll see what I mean. \n\nThat’s about all I wanted to say! So if you’re interested in doing a CC/OC or OC/OC romance plot, shoot me a chat here on Reddit! But before you do, PLEASE read the pinned post on my profile. There’s one more topic I wanna mention but feel it’s easiest to mention in a separate post. When you message me, include the answer to the question I asked in there, tell me what you’re interested in (OC/OC or if you want to play canon), any ideas or expectations you have, and anything else you wanna include! Please show interest, if you don’t seem interested then I’m not going to waste either of our times. \n\nHope to hear from you soon! \n'}"

I really need a job that pays something. I'm very good at coding but my GPA is weak because I don't go to class enough. It's a private school with a not go great reputation for CS so I can't get a lot of interviews. So my school has a hackathon and I joined a team. I didn't know the other guys and they pretty much left me alone most of the time. I started playing with Google Germini just to kill time mostly. I tried to get it to write some malware to mess with my teammates but it's not really made for that kind of thing so I just started googling different kinds of malware and I ended up on some phishing sites. I made a phishing email and sent it to one of the hackathon judges who worked for a F1000 company in HR or something. They were giving away video cards and holding mock interviews during the hackathon. I tried the mock interview so I got a little intel about the person. Anyway, they fell for the phishing email and I acquired their user name and password. I was able to log into the HR portal for the company. From there I made an offer to myself and then I went to my email and accepted it. The HR software added me to a cohort and gave me a start date. I could even see the other people in the cohort so I emailed a few of them to let them know I was one of them. Now I have a job and it seems legit but I wasn't able to figure out how to change the job title so I think I am an Associate Software Engineer. I am afraid to go back into the system and try to change it at this point. I don't know if I should just show up on my start day and roll with it. Maybe I have nothing to lose any way. ""}"

Reddit,GOOGL,"{'title': 'Why Your Business’s Visibility and Ranking on Google My Business Matter More Than Ever', 'content': '**Why Google My Business Matter More Than Ever**\n\nLet’s talk about why your **visibility and ranking** on GMB are crucial to your success.\n\n# 1. First Impressions Happen Online\n\nWhen someone searches for a service or product locally, they’re likely to start with a Google search. In fact, studies show that **76% of people** who search for something nearby visit a business within a day. If your GMB profile doesn’t show up in the top results, potential customers won’t even know you exist. Your business could be incredible, but if it’s not visible online, you’re losing out.\n\n# 2. Build Trust and Credibility\n\nWhen you rank higher on Google My Business, you’re more likely to be seen as trustworthy. Consumers are more likely to visit or choose a business that ranks higher because it gives the impression of being more established and reliable. A complete, optimized GMB profile with consistent updates, positive reviews, and relevant photos builds credibility and makes your business more attractive to potential customers.\n\n# 3. It’s Free Marketing!\n\nOne of the best parts of using Google My Business is that it’s a **free marketing tool**. By simply optimizing your profile, you can significantly increase your business’s visibility. This means more customers finding you through Google Search and Google Maps without spending money on ads. The more optimized your profile, the better your chances of appearing in the local 3-pack – the top three businesses that appear in local search results.\n\n# 4. Local SEO Equals Local Customers\n\nGoogle’s algorithms prioritize local businesses in their search results when users look for nearby services. This means that having an optimized GMB profile helps your business show up when it matters most – when potential customers are searching for businesses in your area. Your GMB profile is an essential part of your **Local SEO strategy**, and ranking well in local search results can drive significant traffic to your website and physical location.\n\n# 5. Increased Customer Engagement\n\nDid you know that Google My Business offers features that allow customers to engage directly with your business? From leaving reviews and booking appointments to messaging your business directly, GMB makes it easy for customers to take action. A well-optimized profile not only attracts more views but also encourages more interaction. The more active your GMB profile, the more likely customers will engage with it.\n\n# 6. Insights and Analytics\n\nGMB provides valuable insights into how customers are finding and interacting with your business. You can track how many people are viewing your profile, how they’re finding you, and what actions they’re taking (like visiting your website or requesting directions). This data helps you continuously improve your strategy, ensuring your business stays competitive and visible.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nYour business’s visibility on Google My Business can be the difference between gaining a new customer or losing them to a competitor. To rank higher, focus on optimizing every element of your GMB profile – from accurate business information to positive reviews and engaging posts. With the right strategy, you’ll see your local visibility grow, bringing in more foot traffic and online interactions.\n\nIf you haven’t yet, start by claiming your GMB profile, optimizing it, and watch your business rank higher and thrive!\n\n#GoogleMyBusiness #LocalSEO #BusinessGrowth #GMBOptimization #DigitalMarketing'}"

Unlike many web design agencies who are experts in MSU (making stuff up) and regularly cut corners at clients’ expenses (but to their quick payday), Jeremy guarantees his work.  \n\nOne of the reasons why Jeremy can stand behind his work is because his team only implements strategies for their clients after they’ve been thoroughly tested and proven to produce consistent results. \n\n Jeremy McGilvrey’s web design agency is committed to delivering exceptional service to their clients. They understand the frustrations of working with unreliable marketing agencies and are determined to provide a superior experience to the clients they serve.'}"
