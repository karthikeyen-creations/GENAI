EB|LOG:EXITBS:START, even after  following its troubleshooting suggestion.\n\nIt stuck after: `OCSMC: SmcReadValue Key 4D535463 Size 1` and `OCSMC: SmcReadValue Key 4D534163 Size 2`, which many on the web suggest due to iGPU issue.\n\nHope to get more feedback on this, whether another debugging suggestion or simply a working EFI :)\n\nThank you.\n\nPlanned OSX install: `Sonoma 14.7.` USB boot drive

(+\ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f) Update #71. Playing Event Forecast Contracts.", "content": "# General Update\n\nSince the [last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1fsaa3w/yolo_update_no_longer_going_all_in_on_steel/), my trading of /MES futures using [EfficientEnzyme's](https://x.com/efficientenzyme) levels and occasional attempts at puts  have been net positive. I'll go over some more recent trades along with my current stock positioning thoughts later in this update. As I've reached a level of being about 1/3 of my cash deployed and much has changed since the last update, I figured I'd write one up this weekend.\n\nFor the usual disclaimer up front,\u00a0**the following is not financial advice and I could be wrong about anything in this post.**\u00a0This is just my thought process for how I am playing my personal investment portfolio.\n\n# Macro Thoughts\n\nThe [last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1fsaa3w/yolo_update_no_longer_going_all_in_on_steel/) was fairly accurate in the end on the path of the market. We got a dip that was minor (far more minor than I ever expected) and then continued upward. Economic data remains strong and market participants don't mind the new stretched valuations. There is a spot gamma video recently \\[[timestamped link](https://www.youtube.com/live/qXY5kIVhoBQ?si=HbJa9YjWLW6nruk2&t=1185)\\] that points out that the volatility market has started to price in an end of the year rally now.\n\nAs mentioned last time, as expectations for earnings have come down, stock prices have remain elevated. This goes beyond just my example of $AAPL from that previous update. As Wasteland Capital points out \\[[here](https://x.com/ecommerceshares/status/1845941837447532773)\\], earnings revisions have been the most negative since December 2022. This sets up easier \"expectation beats\" despite stocks generally being at ATH levels still. Can there still be negative earnings reactions? Sure. But as a stock price reacts positively most of the time on an expectations beat, the setup just isn't great for earnings to cause a market reversal. Investors are just willing to pay more for the same future earnings that will now be \"beats\".\n\nIn other macro updates:\n\n* u/vazdooh posted their market update video \\[[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRwVNtUBL9U)\\] and mentions the puts he had bought ([twitter link](https://x.com/vazdooh/status/1846961309318857066)). But they state they are no longer bearish and plan to exit the puts on any small pullback. He has joined the \"market will just go up\" side.\n* There is a YouTube channel called \"Internet of Bugs\" that I watch which has been evaluating LLM models for Software Engineering. Up until his most recent video, these models wouldn't generate great results and he has been a skeptic of their usefulness. ChatGPT-O1 seems to have changed his mind on the potential of LLM models for low level coding though. This \\[[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0yKLumIbaM)\\] is where he tries that model and concludes it is roughly as good as a new graduate with 0-3 months of experience. Just an interesting watch as while the market expectations for generative AI remain elevated beyond what I think generative AI can achieve, there is some progress being made on their usefulness.\n\n# Current Stock Positions\n\nWith the market determined to normalize higher valuations, I mentioned last time that I wasn't going to chase. Thus my current plan has been to switch to slowly accumulating positions of individual stocks that are fundamentally still fairly valued. It beats owning the S&P500 or Nasdaq at current valuations. This process is likely going to take some time and I'll evaluate if I want to sell after the \"Santa Rally\". (Note: one possibility is also selling CSPs over just directly owning stocks which I am considering on a few tickers). I'll also likely keep some free cash available in case an attractive entry appears to take a \"primary position\" in something. To go over the two current picks:\n\n[Fidelity Individual Account \\(Taxable\\)](https://preview.redd.it/sp5l9ybmvuvd1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=766b99be0edf74bdcc40e3173966c7054bee80ed)\n\n \n\n[Fidelity IRA Account](https://preview.redd.it/ysnbrakovuvd1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b3c85b52d766a6bc7f9c8ca90487fc9c5ec5e40)\n\n**$CI**\n\nWith rumors of a buyout offer on $HUM floating around, I bought that $HUM stock at $267.80 right after market close. A few minutes later, a Bloomberg article would come out that $CI had entered into informal merge talks with them \\[[article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-resumes-merger-discussions-humana-205945449.html)\\]. This caused $HUM to spike upward and $CI to move downward. Given that this was just informal talks and $HUM is expected to struggle with their higher Medicare utilization rate and start rating downgrade for the next few years, I took profit at $283.20. I then bought a smaller amount of $CI as that stock still has a forward P/E of around 10 and I doubt they would overpay for $HUM given the situation $HUM finds itself in. With the entire Medicare Advantage segment struggling, there likely just isn't a need to pay a large premium and $CI did walk away last year when $HUM demanded too much for the company.\n\n**$DAC**\n\nI've owned this company that leases ships before and it still has the same pros/cons. Valuation is cheap at 3 P/E (both historical and forward). It pays a 3.8% dividend and has about 1/3 of its share value in cash. The company is less dependent on shipping rates than something like $ZIM. They just tend to be conservative about shareholder returns that keeps the stock from being valued much higher.\n\n# The New Forecast Contract Market\n\nInteractive Brokers (IBKR) recently launched a market for predicting event outcomes that one can view \\[[here](https://forecasttrader.interactivebrokers.com/eventtrader)\\]. They have a page that explains it all \\[[here](https://forecasttrader.interactivebrokers.com/en/learn.php)\\] but the main points are:\n\n* Each contract pays out $1 if on the correct side and $0 if one the side that didn't occur.\n* There are no commissions or fees currently.\n* One earns a 4.x% annualized yield on the value of the contract held until that event closes.\n\nWhen it initially appeared, I took a look but didn't enable it for my account. Then a whale started to skew the presidential betting markets for trump with a sample article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-things-know-mystery-30-172117294.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-things-know-mystery-30-172117294.html) . While IBKR's market didn't reach the levels of those based on Crypto, what has been seen as a 50/50 election started to offer better odds than that. I decided the change in betting odds made the risk to reward worth it and now own the following contracts:\n\n[Cost basis of $0.44 a contract that will either pay out $0 or $1. The first batch is \\\\\"YES\\\\\" for Kamala to win and the second batch is \\\\\"No\\\\\" for Trump to win. Market value of the bet right now: $164,764.74.](https://preview.redd.it/53oe3f6guuvd1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8f9531c48ee1d766dab39aa113d7497e03dc76d)\n\nIs this a large bet? It is. But losing it won't wipe me out as I'm not \"all in\" on the play and won't be adding much more to this gamble. This isn't much different from doing a merger arbitrage play with options (such as what I had done with Amazon trying to acquire iRobot earlier this year that gave me most of my YTD losses). It just has the best risk/reward setup given the 50/50 view of the election outcome by experts.\n\nBut beyond what the polling indicates for the 50/50 odds, I just also want to believe the odds are better than the polls indicate myself. I don't want to delve into politics in this series so I'll keep this brief. This isn't a bet of \"Democrat vs Republican\". This is specifically a bet against Donald Trump and I wouldn't be making it if the Republican party had almost any other candidate. I've deleted my brief reasoning for this as I don't want to encourage a political debate here. I respect if you feel the opposite of me here and feel free to inverse my bet. :) After all, this is just my personal trading blog and the reasoning behind the bets I'm taking.\n\nAnother comment to add here is that the IBKR platform could be a superior way to play some macro events over trying to predict how $SPY or $QQQ might react. (The platform is for more than just betting on political outcomes). Often one might guess something like CPI to come in hot/cold to consensus but the market reacts differently than that print might suggest. Depends on what the betting odds are for that event but I'll likely keep my eye on it in the future if the market prices in some crazy macro stuff.\n\nOne thing I've not been able to find is information on the tax treatment for these contracts. I'd guess it just gets taxed as gambling winnings? My attempts to search for an answer to this haven't yielded anything. If anyone happens to stumble upon that piece of information or just happens to know, I'd appreciate the sharing of that information. :)\n\nOne final additional aside: I did connect my IBKR account to the [After Hour](https://www.afterhour.com/) application u/SIR\\_JACK\\_A\\_LOT created but that hasn't been worthwhile since nothing I trade actually shows up there? It doesn't seem to support $SPX options, /MES futures contracts, or these new type of event contracts. (This is all in addition to Fidelity still not being supported unless something changed recently). I think the whole verification concept of the platform is neat and I respect what u/SIR\\_JACK\\_A\\_LOT is trying to build. It just never ends up working out for me when I try it. ><\n\n# Current Realized Gains (excluding 401k)\n\n**Fidelity (Taxable)**\n\n* Realized YTD loss of -$417,484.\n   * Gain of $31,209 compared to\u00a0[last numbers update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1euddjh/https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1ezrals/yolo_update_no_longer_going_all_in_on_steel//).\n\n[Taken from Fidelity Active Trader Pro.](https://preview.redd.it/n2swes1isuvd1.png?width=262&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3720cfae146a9720ab3059f108d864c5c67a0d3)\n\n**Fidelity (IRA)**\n\n* Realized YTD loss of -$7,707.\n   * Gain of $2,062 compared to\u00a0[last numbers update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1euddjh/https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1ezrals/yolo_update_no_longer_going_all_in_on_steel//).\n\n[Taken from Fidelity Active Trader Pro.](https://preview.redd.it/1llfxciksuvd1.png?width=263&format=png&auto=webp&s=130bc2dffead7a34bf613c9835372ece324de524)\n\n**IBKR (New)**\n\n* Unrealized and Realized YTD gain of $31,513.22.\n\n[YTD report that takes the \\\\\"YTD Change\\\\\" value minus the \\\\\"Net Deposit\\\\\" value.

The market tends to surprise once a consensus on short term direction is reached. Thus my plan to only gradually add smaller positions when I see something that appears worth a buy while I retain a large cash pile. But the stock market isn't the only casino in town as additional ways to gamble on the odds continue to be invented. I've taken the position on IBKR's new event platform that appears to me to offer a good risk/reward ratio as my primary larger sized YOLO. Even if my IBKR bet fails, I'll still be up since 2021 as I'm not going all-in with my entire account on that gamble.\n\nI was glad to see a [post discussing the steel sector](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1g5semb/clf_is_there_a_thesis_still_alive/) on here a few days ago. I think steel companies are interesting but don't feel like adding a position in that sector yet. I still wish there was more good DD on sectors and companies being shared on these boards. ><\n\nOh - and I should mentioned that with economic data coming in strong, longer duration bonds don't seem attractive to me right now. Why? Generally longer duration bonds have a \"duration risk premium\" associated with them. That's why 30 year bonds still yielded around 1.5% when the Fed Funds rate was 0%. If one believes the Fed will cut to only 3% eventually, then the longer end doesn't really drop much due to that duration risk premium likely returning. Selling puts against $TLT can be relatively worthwhile on days it drops so that one either earns that premium or acquires it at a cheaper price. But $TLT above $93 isn't an appealing option over being cash given the recent string of strong economic data imo.\n\nThat about does it for this particular update. The next one will likely only be when I've added more to my positions or have new macro views to share. Feel free to comment to correct me if you disagree with anything I've written as I'm always open to reconsidering my current thinking. As always, these are just my personal opinions on what I'm doing with my portfolio.

We had a site by the name Silicon Investor, where I would eventually start my own stock thread.

In fact, while the last post to that thread occurred in 2008, you can still see the subject and its history here:\n\n[https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=21973](https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=21973)\n\nTokyo Joe would eventually face charges surrounding stock manipulation, etc. It truly is a very similar story to that of WSB. I was a frequent poster on his board and many private conversations with him back in the day before I started seeing the true nature of what was going on.\n\nThe key point here is that herd mentality has always been a part of stock trading and markets. Whether in the short term, or the long term, it's a pure supply-demand scenario. The primary difference between then and now is the size of the herd, and it's a sizable difference. Add in the ability for electronic, algo-driven, high frequency trading on exchanges and you have the ability to move a lot of shares very quickly, potentially 'manipulating' a stock. Again, it's supply and demand in its purest form.\n\nAll stocks have something you should pay attention to:  Float. This is the number of shares available for public trading. Some stocks may have a float of only a few million (or less) while others like $NVDA, could have in the double digit billions. This is where supply and demand economics plays out.\n\nIf you go to the store to purchase lemons and the store has 1,000 lemons in the bin, buying a few lemons will not impact the price. The store may only sell 300 lemons per day and get 300 lemons in shipment the next day to replace the supply. As long as demand is in balance, we have no issue. If the store raises the price on those lemons, people may stop buying them because they can be purchased more cheaply elsewhere. But what happens if/when the store has ONLY 1,000 lemons and suddenly everyone wants lemons. The store may sell 1,000 lemons in a single day and people line up the next morning hoping the story gets a shipment. They do, but because of supply issues, the store can only get 100. Demand will quickly outstrip supply and the store decides they can now charge double for the lemons because they know they will sell out. Rinse and repeat.\n\nNow, in real life, apply this to the toilet paper crisis following Covid.\n\nThe same concept plays out with stocks, but the \"float\" represents the total number of shares available for trade, period. Unless the company decides to issue more shares (dilution) to raise money, the float is the maximum number of shares available for public consumption/trade. This is why they say if you are buying shares in a stock expecting it to rise, you are purchasing the shares from someone expecting it to not go up, or the seller needs to raise cash. It's a barter system.\n\nNow apply this supply/demand construct to a stock with very few shares in the float. If 100,000 /WSB day traders all decide to purchase 100 shares of stock at the same time, that is 10,000,000 shares. If the stock only has 10,000,000 or 20,000,000 shares in the float, demand will far outstrip supply and the price rises because sellers can raise the price knowing there's enough demand to fill the trade. Of course, as we all know, at some point this price-to-demand model fails, demand dries up due to price and then the opposite can play out. Demand dries up, those who purchased decide to take profits, increasing supply and the price falls because too many shares are available with too few buyers.\n\nFloat is a very important variable in how stocks move, the volatility. Any stock with a low float can be manipulated and this is one thing the SEC is watching for. Of course, it's very difficult to prove manipulation. The higher the float of a stock, the more demand it will take to move the stock. if the /WSB group was more focused, they could be targeting low float stocks on a regular basis, moving in and out of them as a herd. It's hard to determine where the manipulation begins and ends. In the end, however, there are always those who caught on late, and end up with losses. The WSB bag holders, those behind the Wendy's dumpster or someone other than your wife's boyfriend. Insert your own WSB colloquialism here.\n\nThis is how stocks move up, down, go to the moon, crash and burn, etc. etc. taking traders along for the euphoric or painful ride. Obviously, in most situations, stocks trade via normal supply and demand as a result to their business model success, events, earnings, etc. Where /WSB started losing its teeth is when they started deemphasizing Sh!t stocks with low floats and decided to start tracking larger float quality names. The supply/demand model still plays out, but with less volatility due to the size of float in most of these stocks. High float, more demand needed to move the stock, less volatility.\n\n**My Single Best Trade**\n\nI have a long, maybe even storied, history in the markets. From full-on day trader back in the 90s and early 2000's to today. Back in mid 2020, I started accumulating a small marijuana stock by the name of Tilray ($TLRY), partly because we were in an election year and the republicans held office, there was continuing interest in marijuana legalization (I have never even tried the stuff), and I was starting to see more and more forum interest on the name, especially on /WSB.\n\nTLRY had a lower float, was gaining in popularity and there were other catalysts that I felt made it a worthwhile swing trade, maybe even a long term hold if legalization efforts broadened, the model worked and TLRY became very profitable.\n\nMaking a long story short, I started a two-phase position by a risk-weighted multiple-thousand share position between $4-$5/share in mid 2020. The stock was percolating but not moving materially for any length of time. After one particular volume spike, followed by a quick rise in price, the stock swelled to $7 but fell quickly back to $5. But what I noticed was the volume, /WSB mention and that price spike. When the stock settled again, volume was back to normal. Deciding to trade around my long shares, I started accumulating $5 leap (long dated) calls. What followed were events that I could not have accurately predicted. The democrats ended up in office, helping all pot stocks. TLRY's model was gaining favor as one of the largest producers. But what really took the top off was that /WSB erupted in all things TLRY for about a two week period beginning in Feb. 2021. The rise leading up to the spike was good, taking the stock to $20 and I peeled off some shares and even some of the calls to protect profits, leaving most of the position in place. The the day or two that followed, the stock erupted from $20, to an intraday price of more than $70. Fear and Greed in my own head kicked in and I waited and watched, eventually deciding to pull the trigger on the entire position around $60 as the stock started falling. I exited the entire position between $55-$60.\n\nChart for this time period is below.\n\n[TLRY - 6 mos. Chart](https://preview.redd.it/m38wqe3wgqvd1.png?width=1601&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2fd3997fa22676b05c83ca973be9bb4435236c4)\n\nThe % gain on the position was massive, both in liquidation of the long shares and, especially the Calls. In this case, my prudence still limited the gain to a % of what it could have been because I am never willing to allow a speculative position to occupy too heavy a weight due to risk management. It's fun to dream what this trade could have yielded if I was a true WSB degenerate but it was still quite sizable and material to the overall account. For relation, even as a right-sized speculation weight, the gain from this single trade boosted the account value by more than 25%, in a tax-advantaged account.\n\nTLRY is now back to $1.50 per share. It's model continues to erode. The fervor is gone but the potential remains simply due to history. TLRY is also a perfect example of one of my Phoenix trades (you can search for that on this sub). At one point in the past, TLRY spiked to $300. That is an important aspect to a phoenix trade.\n\nThis is how speculation can work but, in most cases, it does not. Traders chase profits like these but a vast majority of time it ends in fire and flames, bag holders and loss porn. Sometimes a big gain is the worst thing an individual can have. Those without discipline to understand fear, greed and gambling are lined up for a trip to complete ruin. I never tried to recreate this trade though I still dabble in right-sized speculation ($SOUN) on the potential. Keep positions very low in % and very few in number.\n\nLightning can strike but do yourself a favor and never expect and, if it does strike, don't expect it to strike again in the same place.\n\nLearn to look at \"float\" for an opportunity for long term gains. Low float stocks with good business models can split, increasing your shares and leading to incredible profits. You only need one $AAPL, $MSFT, $NVDA, $NFLX, $CSCO, $META, $GOOGL to go to the moon and take your net worth with it.

Isn't this technically exercising a contract that is out of the money, with 235.01 being the start of \"In the money\"? Is exercising it something that is automatically done by Vanguard or is there something I am missing that would cause someone to choose to exercise this?"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "AAPL", "page_content": {"title": "Wealth Realization - we are fools trying not to be foolish", "content": "Hello r/FatFIRE community!

The key benefit is receiving a large K1 loss (up to 8x ordinary income or 10x capital gains) relative to your capital contribution. This could potentially defer taxes for long periods, with the loan renewable every 15 years without triggering taxable gains, as long as you don't exit early.\n\t\u2022\tExample: A $300K capital contribution generates a $2.7M loan (9x), creating a $3M tax basis to offset $3M in capital gains.\n\t\u2022\tCost: 3.5% of the K1 value upfront, plus an additional 4% fee to cover taxes on the gains in the first year. For a $3M capital gain, this would total $225K.\n\t\u2022\tNet Cash Benefit: $450K saved compared to paying $855K in taxes without the strategy.\n\t\u2022\tNote: This strategy defers both federal and state taxes.\n\tQuestion: Has anyone here used a similar program? How did it work out in terms of long-term benefits and risks?\n\nTax Credits (Sovereign Tribal Federal Tax Credits):\nInvest in infrastructure improvements to Native Americans, to help them build water treatments, schools, roads, etc. this gives them money for big projects and in return you get tax credits to help lower federal taxes. They were granted tax credits for exactly this purpose. \n\t\u2022\tThese credits are available for 60 cents on the dollar, with a minimum investment of $60,000.\n\t\u2022\tThey offset federal tax liability dollar-for-dollar, with the ability to carry forward unused credits for up to five years.\n\t\u2022\tNote: This does not affect state taxes.\n\t\nQuestion: Have you used tax credits to offset liabilities? Do you think these credits provide significant value relative to their cost?\n\t\nLeverage Charitable Donation:\n\t\u2022\tThis option eliminates taxes through charitable donations, with fewer future concerns than the SOP but potentially slightly lower savings.\n\tQuestion: What are your thoughts on structured donations for tax savings vs. something like SOP?\n\t\nAsset Protection and Estate Planning:\n\t\u2022\tWe are in the process of setting up trusts to protect assets and manage estate taxes.\n\tQuestion: What strategies have you used to stay below estate tax limits and protect assets effectively?\n\t\nInvestment Strategy:\n\t\u2022\tWe\u2019re discussing selling and diversifying up to half of our AAPL stock to balance growth potential with risk management.\n\tQuestion: How do you manage the diversification of large, single-stock positions while maintaining strong growth prospects?\n\nAdditional Thoughts:\n\t\u2022\tLong-term Wealth Management Considerations:\n\t\u2022\tShift from growth to preservation mindset\n\t\u2022\tDiversification away from concentrated position\n\t\u2022\tEstate planning: trusts, staying below estate tax limits\n\t\u2022\tPotential future gifts to children (e.g., paying off mortgages)\n\t\u2022\tPersonal Reflections:\n\t\u2022\tStruggle to shift from frugal mindset to higher spending\n\t\u2022\tDesire for experiences (e.g., family trips) vs. continued wealth accumulation\n\t\u2022\tBalancing prudent financial management with enjoying wealth\n\t\u2022\tOur AGI for the past five years has been around $55K.\n\t\u2022\tWe also gift the maximum stock to our four successful adult children annually.\n\t\u2022\tWe\u2019re considering a 2025 stock liquidation amount between $500K and $3M, might even sell up to $8M.\n\nThanks for taking a moment to read.

Lived in Europe and in America as a child. Moved around the US often as an adult. Started life in middle class, always had the basics like shelter, food, healthcare, although both parents came from slightly above poverty households. Family not particularly close, after 16 it felt like I was emancipated and have been on my own ever since. My life goals at 18 were to have a car, apartment and make $35K/yr which was enough for the \u201cgood life\u201d in the LCOL area. Relationship wise I want a life partner but have zero desire for children.\n\n**CAREER**. Tech exec with $980K annual comp. Multiple STEM degrees, technical certifications, business degree and certifications. First half of my career was in a \u201c*boring industry*\u201d, switched to tech and never looked back. Stayed around emerging (new) technologies as I knew with limited experience I could get paid top dollar.\n\n**RELATIONSHIP WITH MONEY**. It\u2019s toxic AF \u263a\ufe0f\u2026seriously, through listening, research and therapy I realized I equate money to safety. Most of my life I\u2019ve had zero support and needed to save money to take care of myself and child or else I felt I\u2019d be out on the street homeless. The environment I came from felt unsafe (e.g. held at gunpoint as a teenager) so the idea of no money, on the streets homeless and a lack of ability to keep myself safe was frightening and not something I would let happen. This emotional state stayed with me through making hundreds of thousands of dollars resulting in comparatively small spending vs my pay as I needed to save it all or else I\u2019d be homeless or destitute, even when making hundreds of thousands with less than $100K in annual expenses.\n\n**FIRE INTRODUCTION**. I originally hated FIRE as everyone thought I jumped on a FIRE bandwagon although I\u2019ve been planning for early retirement since 17. I watched a few FIRE people on YouTube, which made me want to further stay away from the group as they seem like sleezeballs and not knowledgeable. Eventually I got exposed to the right communities and found people in similar situations to me, with more knowledge than me across various topics (e.g. taxes) and felt the portion of the FIRE community I engaged with is an asset and accelerated my growth. I can\u2019t overstate how important it was to have others in a similar situation as me that I could ask questions to for navigating a unique, somewhat taboo situation. The reason I\u2019m sharing in the event it helps someone else.\n\n**DECISION TO RETIRE**. I made a plan at 17 to retire early at 45 as I rationalized \u201ceveryone hates their jobs, might as well save up a lot of money and escape that hell sooner than later.\u201d I realize now the negative viewpoint was driven by the adults in my life that I saw not enjoying work. This viewpoint also stayed with me throughout my career, probably allowing me to suffer and deal with more shit because I expected work to be bad. More bad stuff I deAlt with (vs just complaining) the higher I rose. This thought process broke for me when I was making $1M/yr at $1T company. There were three people between me and the CEO and I did not envy or want any of their jobs. I saw people lose their family members and could only take off one day to mourn over a three-day weekend because they were a busy, important executive and couldn\u2019t step away. Another guy literally had a broken back and was in meetings slouched over a chair versus recovering. One person looked like at any given moment, they would have a stroke and die. Their eyes were always twitching and they had pretty bad health. I asked myself, if they are making way more than $1M a year and have a high net worth but can\u2019t prioritize their health or family any more than someone working a low-level factory job, what is the use? At the same time I found all the sacrifices I made to get to the top were now extremely difficult if not impossible. Once I had FI, for lack of better words, I gave no fucks. I actually loved to work and shaping industries for emerging technologies but hated the political nature which was the primary part of my role as an exec, not the technology. Work became no fun and not necessary so I decided to retire, although it took a lot of emotional turmoil to get to the point of pulling the trigger. Almost as soon as I decided I no longer need to work for money, my dream company came along and offered me a job at $2M/year. I LoL\u2019d, thought the universe was really trying to test my resolve and declined the role.\n\n**FIRE TARGET**. This was a continually moving goal, and not for practical reasons. As mentioned, money is security for me so the more neurotic I got the larger the FIRE number I needed to feel secure. It didn\u2019t help to have many coworkers that were multimillionaires telling me anything under $5M net worth is the equivalent of being in poverty and I shouldn\u2019t stop until at least $15M. Ironically, these people were at or past those numbers and still mostly unhappy. Also my 90% safe SWR is 4.84% (not 4%) and my bulletproof SWR is 4.04% (not 3.25%). My original FIRE target was $10K/mo or $2.5M. That number changed at some point to $5M but then got back to where I settled which was $2.7M. At $2.7M or $11K/mo I was no longer trading off time for money.\n\n**RETIREMENT BUDGET**. Before retiring my spend was roughly $7K/mo or $84K/year. In a MCOL city I stayed in a luxury high-rise ($2,700), drove a luxury vehicle ($1,100), had a healthy food budget ($1,750), got regular massages ($400) and had disposable income ($1,000+) left over. That is in addition to investing the majority of my income. My retirement budget differs in the fact that I will no longer be living in the US, which winds up being cheaper (e.g. health insurance) for a better quality of life. Of the places I\u2019ve looked at, either $5K/mo (e.g. SE Asia, LATAM) or $8K/mo (e.g. Europe, Middle East) was enough to live an upper class life (#ChubbyFire). Actual expenses below for two MCOL cities, one in the US (as backup) and my international destination.\n\n**Budget A (International |**  $6,700 Total**)**\n\n* Rent: $3,500\n* Transportation: $400 (private driver, Lexus)\n* Food: $1,500\n* Insurance: $400\n* Gym: $200\n* Massage: $400\n* Misc: $300\n\n**Budget B (US |** $8,800 Total**)**\n\n* $1,500 BMW i4\n* $1,750 Food\n* $3,750 Luxury High-rise premier zipcode\n* $850 Insurance\n* $300 Misc bills, subscriptions\n* $400 Massages\n* $250 Gym\n\n**PORTFOLIO**. Breakout of $3.4M NW.\n\n* **HYSA**: $651K - all from a recent influx of cash. To protect both of us it\u2019s better I don\u2019t disclose how and you don\u2019t ask \ud83d\ude09. Will most likely invest $500K of this, but still determining where. Currently sits in Vanguard Federal (VMFXX).\n* **Bank**: $8K - random transactional cash. Try to keep this at $20K or less.\n* **Crypto**: $235K - started at $70K, got up to $450K. Will sell next time it hits $400K+\n* **Investment (post-tax)**: $2,415K - Includes VTSAX, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, KO, AMD, QCOM. Most of the money is in VTSAX, periodically I got hundred thousand dollar bonuses and go into an individual stock if I saw they were significantly undervalued and I knew enough about the industry to make a relevant call on the stock\u2019s value (e.g. picking tech vs healthcare companies).\n* **Investment (pre-tax)**: $100K - 401(k). Used sparingly as I knew I didn\u2019t want money tied in an account I didn\u2019t have access to until late 60s which also incurs early withdrawal tax penalties. 100% of the retirement is a VTSAX equivalent.\u00a0\n\n$3.4M total. 4.84% SWR: $13,713/mo. Left Over After Expenses: $7K/mo\u00a0 (internationally) and $5K/mo (US).\n\n**SWR PHILOSOPHY**: As mentioned, my relationship with money was driven by fear/insecurity/generally bad stuff. This impacted my SWR by making me pick the lowest possible percentage that was \u201cguaranteed\u201d to be safe. As I\u2019ve matured closer to retirement, I realize there is no guarantees. I also believe that retiring is not a one-way door, meaning I am retiring from trading my time for money but can return whenever I\u2019d like (albeit for less pay). I also don\u2019t think FIRE equates to not generating money ever again in life. I believe it almost impossible to not generate money ever again as I\u2019m entrepreneurial minded. I\u2019ll now just be doing things for myself and out of enjoyment versus to monetize. I also have the luxury of only needing a SWR of 2.4% to cover all my expenses. Each month I will try to \u201cspend up to\u201d the 4.84% which admittedly will be a struggle but I\u2019m committed to it post reading Die With Zero. The \u201cspend up to\u201d SWR philosophy helps in at least two ways. **1**) If my portfolio gets cut in half and spending gets cut in half, my core lifestyle doesn\u2019t change. I\u2019ve always lived on a fraction of my income so living below my means is easy, living at my means is the hard part. **2**) The ability to significantly cut expenses each month is one of the better safety mechanisms in retirement. There are calculators online that allow you to put in monthly spend fluctuation. The bigger the adjustment you\u2019re able to make, you can either withdraw more money or have a higher probability of success with the same amount of money. I don\u2019t want more money, as I\u2019m struggling to spend what I have but I do want the increased probability of staying successfully retired.\n\n**DEBT**. I have none. No car payment, house payment, student loans, credit card bills, etc.\n\n**TAXES**. I don\u2019t normally factor these in. I expect to take around $120K/yr which I get a standard deduction of $20K and the first $40K/year in capital gains are tax free. As example, taking out $120K, $90K of it is taxable ($30K is the OG investment) and I\u2019d pay 15% or $4.5K ($90K minus $60K tax exempt portion) or $375/mo in taxes. The low effective tax doesn\u2019t change much if I go from $120K to a $165K withdrawal, and as I live well below my top monthly SWR taxes at these levels are negligible.\n\n**ADVICE (recommendations).** Primary advice I\u2019d give below\u2026\n\n1. **Prioritize Health & Relationships**. It\u2019s the most important thing. You can have money but not your health and probably aren\u2019t going to enjoy life. To get to a multimillionaire status before the age of 40 you will probably have to prioritize work/wealth generation over a lot of things, but I don\u2019t recommend consistently prioritizing work over your health and family/relationships. Both can make you spiritually rich and help you become financially rich.\n2. \u00a0**Find Internal Validation**. One of the hardest parts about retiring is losing the validation I got through work. Making $1 million a year, having a nice title, getting access to things others didn\u2019t as I was an executive, etc. all went to my head. Not immediately, not even noticeably but eventually. If most or all of your validation comes from the company you\u2019re at, the work you do and the money you\u2019re getting paid then retiring will be very difficult, regardless of how much money you have. I\u2019ve seen many people post, \u201c*I\u2019m 60, have $XM NW and my health is failing me, I hate my job but don\u2019t know what else to do. I have no friends, personal life, hobbies so I just stay working\u2026*\u201d I\u2019ve never been in this state but do feel for these people. You can avoid the negative state by being able to self validate, which is important for something like FIRE. You are in a unique situation, you\u2019re doing things the average person will never do so you\u2019re not going to get validation from the masses. If anything you\u2019re going to get told the opposite: \u201cdon\u2019t do it, you\u2019re foolish, it\u2019ll never work, why are you wasting your time?\u201d If you can make a decision, do the research and draw a logical conclusion and stick to that you will have a better FIRE experience. Same is true with the need for Reddit validation (e.g. \u201cI read your plan, love it! I\u2019m rooting for you and everyone else does plans like these and they always succeeded, you\u2019ll be fine!\u201d).\n3. **Avoid Financial Neurosis**. Most of western society is focused on overindulgence and mass consumption at the cost of being in debt, slave to corporations, declining mental and physical health, etc. While it was very clear to me spending compulsively is unhealthy, it took a long time to realize my relationship of saving compulsively was unhealthy too. With money I was the equivalent of one of these reality TV show hoarders, well past being an efficient saver because of all of the negative emotions associated with my relationship with money. I see post after post that reads something along the lines of, \u201c*I am unhappy, hate my job, have struggling relationships, my health is failing me and I have $XM NW, can I retire? I\u2019m afraid to\u2026*\u201d That kind of attachment to money/work is unhealthy to me. While I\u2019ve benefited from it, as corporate America rewards and is built on people that think like this, I\u2019ve also suffered from it. I pray others focus on their relationship with money, maintaining a healthy balance and setting appropriate boundaries.\n4. **Use Lifestyle Arbitrage**. As I worked in tech, many friends/associates live in HCOL areas across the West Coast. My $90K/yr MCOL budget was $200K/yr for them for the same lifestyle. For people currently struggling with jobs they hate or who don\u2019t want to have a large FIRE number to support living in a HCOL city, move to a L/MCOL city. For example $1.5M FIRE number ($6K/mo) gives you a good to great life in Lisbon, Mexico City, Bangkok, Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona and many cities across the US. At $2.5M ($10K/mo) I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable living in a HCOL city like NY or San Francisco where at $100K you can still apply for government assistance as you are considered at the poverty line. If you are unhappy, unhealthy, and can retire earlier and it just requires moving\u2026then move.\u00a0\n\n**WHAT\u2019S NEXT**. Another reason I decided to retire was work was getting in the way. I had a lot of hobbies and could not explore them fully. This allowed me to \u201cretire to something\u201d vs \u201cretire from something\u201d which is the difference of running to something you enjoy vs running away from something you hate (former creates better mental health). I enjoy creating which manifest in music and film production, writing short stories and scripts and I\u2019ve written a book. I also like to travel, workout, play sports, attend live sporting events, live music events, plays/theater, watch TV shows, movies, play video games, read, some lounges/parties, etc. I plan to explore these hobbies fully and do things I never got to do (e.g. skiing) while I still have the physical health to do so. In addition to tech, I\u2019ve also worked as a college professor at some top universities. I\u2019m offered up to $1,500 per hour for consulting. Originally, when I planned to retire, I said that I would do both of these things but now I can see I was making the decision from a bad place mentally. I found I need to retire, take some time off of work to just relax and be, then make a decision on what I want to do next. A friend group who retired early from selling a startup told me they had plans on what they would do when they got the money, but it came from their overworked corporate mind which could rationalize spending time consulting or doing some modification of their existing work (not truly stepping away). When they did retire, as example, one guy who was going to consult wound up being a substitute teacher. When I asked him why he said, he never planned on it but realize after FIRE that substitution was one of the few jobs he could have which didn\u2019t require him to work every day and didn\u2019t require him to miss taking his kids to and from school as he works during their school hours. So I too am leaving the space open to allow myself to formulate what I want to do next.\u00a0\n\nAnd that\u2019s all I can think of. Hope this helps. \ud83d\ude0e\u270c\ud83c\udffe\n\nLet me know if you have any FIRE related questions to the above content (not interested in giving career advice, diving into personal non-FIRE topics, etc). "}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "MSFT", "page_content": {"title": "40M @ $3.4M NW\u2026Finally Free \ud83d\udd25", "content": "**ME**. 40M, single, never married with adult kid. Lived in Europe and in America as a child. Moved around the US often as an adult. Started life in middle class, always had the basics like shelter, food, healthcare, although both parents came from slightly above poverty households. Family not particularly close, after 16 it felt like I was emancipated and have been on my own ever since. My life goals at 18 were to have a car, apartment and make $35K/yr which was enough for the \u201cgood life\u201d in the LCOL area. Relationship wise I want a life partner but have zero desire for children.\n\n**CAREER**. Tech exec with $980K annual comp. Multiple STEM degrees, technical certifications, business degree and certifications. First half of my career was in a \u201c*boring industry*\u201d, switched to tech and never looked back. Stayed around emerging (new) technologies as I knew with limited experience I could get paid top dollar.\n\n**RELATIONSHIP WITH MONEY**. It\u2019s toxic AF \u263a\ufe0f\u2026seriously, through listening, research and therapy I realized I equate money to safety. Most of my life I\u2019ve had zero support and needed to save money to take care of myself and child or else I felt I\u2019d be out on the street homeless. The environment I came from felt unsafe (e.g. held at gunpoint as a teenager) so the idea of no money, on the streets homeless and a lack of ability to keep myself safe was frightening and not something I would let happen. This emotional state stayed with me through making hundreds of thousands of dollars resulting in comparatively small spending vs my pay as I needed to save it all or else I\u2019d be homeless or destitute, even when making hundreds of thousands with less than $100K in annual expenses.\n\n**FIRE INTRODUCTION**. I originally hated FIRE as everyone thought I jumped on a FIRE bandwagon although I\u2019ve been planning for early retirement since 17. I watched a few FIRE people on YouTube, which made me want to further stay away from the group as they seem like sleezeballs and not knowledgeable. Eventually I got exposed to the right communities and found people in similar situations to me, with more knowledge than me across various topics (e.g. taxes) and felt the portion of the FIRE community I engaged with is an asset and accelerated my growth. I can\u2019t overstate how important it was to have others in a similar situation as me that I could ask questions to for navigating a unique, somewhat taboo situation. The reason I\u2019m sharing in the event it helps someone else.\n\n**DECISION TO RETIRE**. I made a plan at 17 to retire early at 45 as I rationalized \u201ceveryone hates their jobs, might as well save up a lot of money and escape that hell sooner than later.\u201d I realize now the negative viewpoint was driven by the adults in my life that I saw not enjoying work. This viewpoint also stayed with me throughout my career, probably allowing me to suffer and deal with more shit because I expected work to be bad. More bad stuff I deAlt with (vs just complaining) the higher I rose. This thought process broke for me when I was making $1M/yr at $1T company. There were three people between me and the CEO and I did not envy or want any of their jobs. I saw people lose their family members and could only take off one day to mourn over a three-day weekend because they were a busy, important executive and couldn\u2019t step away. Another guy literally had a broken back and was in meetings slouched over a chair versus recovering. One person looked like at any given moment, they would have a stroke and die. Their eyes were always twitching and they had pretty bad health. I asked myself, if they are making way more than $1M a year and have a high net worth but can\u2019t prioritize their health or family any more than someone working a low-level factory job, what is the use? At the same time I found all the sacrifices I made to get to the top were now extremely difficult if not impossible. Once I had FI, for lack of better words, I gave no fucks. I actually loved to work and shaping industries for emerging technologies but hated the political nature which was the primary part of my role as an exec, not the technology. Work became no fun and not necessary so I decided to retire, although it took a lot of emotional turmoil to get to the point of pulling the trigger. Almost as soon as I decided I no longer need to work for money, my dream company came along and offered me a job at $2M/year. I LoL\u2019d, thought the universe was really trying to test my resolve and declined the role.\n\n**FIRE TARGET**. This was a continually moving goal, and not for practical reasons. As mentioned, money is security for me so the more neurotic I got the larger the FIRE number I needed to feel secure. It didn\u2019t help to have many coworkers that were multimillionaires telling me anything under $5M net worth is the equivalent of being in poverty and I shouldn\u2019t stop until at least $15M. Ironically, these people were at or past those numbers and still mostly unhappy. Also my 90% safe SWR is 4.84% (not 4%) and my bulletproof SWR is 4.04% (not 3.25%). My original FIRE target was $10K/mo or $2.5M. That number changed at some point to $5M but then got back to where I settled which was $2.7M. At $2.7M or $11K/mo I was no longer trading off time for money.\n\n**RETIREMENT BUDGET**. Before retiring my spend was roughly $7K/mo or $84K/year. In a MCOL city I stayed in a luxury high-rise ($2,700), drove a luxury vehicle ($1,100), had a healthy food budget ($1,750), got regular massages ($400) and had disposable income ($1,000+) left over. That is in addition to investing the majority of my income. My retirement budget differs in the fact that I will no longer be living in the US, which winds up being cheaper (e.g. health insurance) for a better quality of life. Of the places I\u2019ve looked at, either $5K/mo (e.g. SE Asia, LATAM) or $8K/mo (e.g. Europe, Middle East) was enough to live an upper class life (#ChubbyFire). Actual expenses below for two MCOL cities, one in the US (as backup) and my international destination.\n\n**Budget A (International |**  $6,700 Total**)**\n\n* Rent: $3,500\n* Transportation: $400 (private driver, Lexus)\n* Food: $1,500\n* Insurance: $400\n* Gym: $200\n* Massage: $400\n* Misc: $300\n\n**Budget B (US |** $8,800 Total**)**\n\n* $1,500 BMW i4\n* $1,750 Food\n* $3,750 Luxury High-rise premier zipcode\n* $850 Insurance\n* $300 Misc bills, subscriptions\n* $400 Massages\n* $250 Gym\n\n**PORTFOLIO**. Breakout of $3.4M NW.\n\n* **HYSA**: $651K - all from a recent influx of cash. To protect both of us it\u2019s better I don\u2019t disclose how and you don\u2019t ask \ud83d\ude09. Will most likely invest $500K of this, but still determining where. Currently sits in Vanguard Federal (VMFXX).\n* **Bank**: $8K - random transactional cash. Try to keep this at $20K or less.\n* **Crypto**: $235K - started at $70K, got up to $450K. Will sell next time it hits $400K+\n* **Investment (post-tax)**: $2,415K - Includes VTSAX, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, KO, AMD, QCOM. Most of the money is in VTSAX, periodically I got hundred thousand dollar bonuses and go into an individual stock if I saw they were significantly undervalued and I knew enough about the industry to make a relevant call on the stock\u2019s value (e.g. picking tech vs healthcare companies).\n* **Investment (pre-tax)**: $100K - 401(k). Used sparingly as I knew I didn\u2019t want money tied in an account I didn\u2019t have access to until late 60s which also incurs early withdrawal tax penalties. 100% of the retirement is a VTSAX equivalent.\u00a0\n\n$3.4M total. 4.84% SWR: $13,713/mo. Left Over After Expenses: $7K/mo\u00a0 (internationally) and $5K/mo (US).\n\n**SWR PHILOSOPHY**: As mentioned, my relationship with money was driven by fear/insecurity/generally bad stuff. This impacted my SWR by making me pick the lowest possible percentage that was \u201cguaranteed\u201d to be safe. As I\u2019ve matured closer to retirement, I realize there is no guarantees. I also believe that retiring is not a one-way door, meaning I am retiring from trading my time for money but can return whenever I\u2019d like (albeit for less pay). I also don\u2019t think FIRE equates to not generating money ever again in life. I believe it almost impossible to not generate money ever again as I\u2019m entrepreneurial minded. I\u2019ll now just be doing things for myself and out of enjoyment versus to monetize. I also have the luxury of only needing a SWR of 2.4% to cover all my expenses. Each month I will try to \u201cspend up to\u201d the 4.84% which admittedly will be a struggle but I\u2019m committed to it post reading Die With Zero. The \u201cspend up to\u201d SWR philosophy helps in at least two ways. **1**) If my portfolio gets cut in half and spending gets cut in half, my core lifestyle doesn\u2019t change. I\u2019ve always lived on a fraction of my income so living below my means is easy, living at my means is the hard part. **2**) The ability to significantly cut expenses each month is one of the better safety mechanisms in retirement. There are calculators online that allow you to put in monthly spend fluctuation. The bigger the adjustment you\u2019re able to make, you can either withdraw more money or have a higher probability of success with the same amount of money. I don\u2019t want more money, as I\u2019m struggling to spend what I have but I do want the increased probability of staying successfully retired.\n\n**DEBT**. I have none. No car payment, house payment, student loans, credit card bills, etc.\n\n**TAXES**. I don\u2019t normally factor these in. I expect to take around $120K/yr which I get a standard deduction of $20K and the first $40K/year in capital gains are tax free. As example, taking out $120K, $90K of it is taxable ($30K is the OG investment) and I\u2019d pay 15% or $4.5K ($90K minus $60K tax exempt portion) or $375/mo in taxes. The low effective tax doesn\u2019t change much if I go from $120K to a $165K withdrawal, and as I live well below my top monthly SWR taxes at these levels are negligible.\n\n**ADVICE (recommendations).** Primary advice I\u2019d give below\u2026\n\n1. **Prioritize Health & Relationships**. It\u2019s the most important thing. You can have money but not your health and probably aren\u2019t going to enjoy life. To get to a multimillionaire status before the age of 40 you will probably have to prioritize work/wealth generation over a lot of things, but I don\u2019t recommend consistently prioritizing work over your health and family/relationships. Both can make you spiritually rich and help you become financially rich.\n2. \u00a0**Find Internal Validation**. One of the hardest parts about retiring is losing the validation I got through work. Making $1 million a year, having a nice title, getting access to things others didn\u2019t as I was an executive, etc. all went to my head. Not immediately, not even noticeably but eventually. If most or all of your validation comes from the company you\u2019re at, the work you do and the money you\u2019re getting paid then retiring will be very difficult, regardless of how much money you have. I\u2019ve seen many people post, \u201c*I\u2019m 60, have $XM NW and my health is failing me, I hate my job but don\u2019t know what else to do. I have no friends, personal life, hobbies so I just stay working\u2026*\u201d I\u2019ve never been in this state but do feel for these people. You can avoid the negative state by being able to self validate, which is important for something like FIRE. You are in a unique situation, you\u2019re doing things the average person will never do so you\u2019re not going to get validation from the masses. If anything you\u2019re going to get told the opposite: \u201cdon\u2019t do it, you\u2019re foolish, it\u2019ll never work, why are you wasting your time?\u201d If you can make a decision, do the research and draw a logical conclusion and stick to that you will have a better FIRE experience. Same is true with the need for Reddit validation (e.g. \u201cI read your plan, love it! I\u2019m rooting for you and everyone else does plans like these and they always succeeded, you\u2019ll be fine!\u201d).\n3. **Avoid Financial Neurosis**. Most of western society is focused on overindulgence and mass consumption at the cost of being in debt, slave to corporations, declining mental and physical health, etc. While it was very clear to me spending compulsively is unhealthy, it took a long time to realize my relationship of saving compulsively was unhealthy too. With money I was the equivalent of one of these reality TV show hoarders, well past being an efficient saver because of all of the negative emotions associated with my relationship with money. I see post after post that reads something along the lines of, \u201c*I am unhappy, hate my job, have struggling relationships, my health is failing me and I have $XM NW, can I retire? I\u2019m afraid to\u2026*\u201d That kind of attachment to money/work is unhealthy to me. While I\u2019ve benefited from it, as corporate America rewards and is built on people that think like this, I\u2019ve also suffered from it. I pray others focus on their relationship with money, maintaining a healthy balance and setting appropriate boundaries.\n4. **Use Lifestyle Arbitrage**. As I worked in tech, many friends/associates live in HCOL areas across the West Coast. My $90K/yr MCOL budget was $200K/yr for them for the same lifestyle. For people currently struggling with jobs they hate or who don\u2019t want to have a large FIRE number to support living in a HCOL city, move to a L/MCOL city. For example $1.5M FIRE number ($6K/mo) gives you a good to great life in Lisbon, Mexico City, Bangkok, Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona and many cities across the US. At $2.5M ($10K/mo) I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable living in a HCOL city like NY or San Francisco where at $100K you can still apply for government assistance as you are considered at the poverty line. If you are unhappy, unhealthy, and can retire earlier and it just requires moving\u2026then move.\u00a0\n\n**WHAT\u2019S NEXT**. Another reason I decided to retire was work was getting in the way. I had a lot of hobbies and could not explore them fully. This allowed me to \u201cretire to something\u201d vs \u201cretire from something\u201d which is the difference of running to something you enjoy vs running away from something you hate (former creates better mental health). I enjoy creating which manifest in music and film production, writing short stories and scripts and I\u2019ve written a book. I also like to travel, workout, play sports, attend live sporting events, live music events, plays/theater, watch TV shows, movies, play video games, read, some lounges/parties, etc. I plan to explore these hobbies fully and do things I never got to do (e.g. skiing) while I still have the physical health to do so. In addition to tech, I\u2019ve also worked as a college professor at some top universities. I\u2019m offered up to $1,500 per hour for consulting. Originally, when I planned to retire, I said that I would do both of these things but now I can see I was making the decision from a bad place mentally. I found I need to retire, take some time off of work to just relax and be, then make a decision on what I want to do next. A friend group who retired early from selling a startup told me they had plans on what they would do when they got the money, but it came from their overworked corporate mind which could rationalize spending time consulting or doing some modification of their existing work (not truly stepping away). When they did retire, as example, one guy who was going to consult wound up being a substitute teacher. When I asked him why he said, he never planned on it but realize after FIRE that substitution was one of the few jobs he could have which didn\u2019t require him to work every day and didn\u2019t require him to miss taking his kids to and from school as he works during their school hours. So I too am leaving the space open to allow myself to formulate what I want to do next.\u00a0\n\nAnd that\u2019s all I can think of.

In fact, it even has its own movie: Dumb Money. Being honest, it was a fun watch while on a flight.\n\nThe interesting thing about WSB is that it's not a new concept, but one that gained popularity because of the popularity of the Internet, Reddit and herd mentality in equal parts to create something that wasn't possible \"back in the day.\" In 1998 I was part of a similar group, but without the wide appeal because we didn't have Reddit back then. We had a site by the name Silicon Investor, where I would eventually start my own stock thread. Similar to Roaring Kitty, \"Tokyo Joe\" started a thread called \"Society Anonyme\" and it quickly became a popular site for high volatility stock trading, discussion and basically the same thing that WSB is today. In fact, while the last post to that thread occurred in 2008, you can still see the subject and its history here:\n\n[https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=21973](https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=21973)\n\nTokyo Joe would eventually face charges surrounding stock manipulation, etc. It truly is a very similar story to that of WSB. I was a frequent poster on his board and many private conversations with him back in the day before I started seeing the true nature of what was going on.\n\nThe key point here is that herd mentality has always been a part of stock trading and markets. Whether in the short term, or the long term, it's a pure supply-demand scenario. The primary difference between then and now is the size of the herd, and it's a sizable difference. Add in the ability for electronic, algo-driven, high frequency trading on exchanges and you have the ability to move a lot of shares very quickly, potentially 'manipulating' a stock. Again, it's supply and demand in its purest form.\n\nAll stocks have something you should pay attention to:  Float. This is the number of shares available for public trading. Some stocks may have a float of only a few million (or less) while others like $NVDA, could have in the double digit billions. This is where supply and demand economics plays out.\n\nIf you go to the store to purchase lemons and the store has 1,000 lemons in the bin, buying a few lemons will not impact the price. The store may only sell 300 lemons per day and get 300 lemons in shipment the next day to replace the supply. As long as demand is in balance, we have no issue. If the store raises the price on those lemons, people may stop buying them because they can be purchased more cheaply elsewhere. But what happens if/when the store has ONLY 1,000 lemons and suddenly everyone wants lemons. The store may sell 1,000 lemons in a single day and people line up the next morning hoping the story gets a shipment. They do, but because of supply issues, the store can only get 100. Demand will quickly outstrip supply and the store decides they can now charge double for the lemons because they know they will sell out. Rinse and repeat.\n\nNow, in real life, apply this to the toilet paper crisis following Covid.\n\nThe same concept plays out with stocks, but the \"float\" represents the total number of shares available for trade, period. Unless the company decides to issue more shares (dilution) to raise money, the float is the maximum number of shares available for public consumption/trade. This is why they say if you are buying shares in a stock expecting it to rise, you are purchasing the shares from someone expecting it to not go up, or the seller needs to raise cash. It's a barter system.\n\nNow apply this supply/demand construct to a stock with very few shares in the float. If 100,000 /WSB day traders all decide to purchase 100 shares of stock at the same time, that is 10,000,000 shares. If the stock only has 10,000,000 or 20,000,000 shares in the float, demand will far outstrip supply and the price rises because sellers can raise the price knowing there's enough demand to fill the trade. Of course, as we all know, at some point this price-to-demand model fails, demand dries up due to price and then the opposite can play out. Demand dries up, those who purchased decide to take profits, increasing supply and the price falls because too many shares are available with too few buyers.\n\nFloat is a very important variable in how stocks move, the volatility. Any stock with a low float can be manipulated and this is one thing the SEC is watching for. Of course, it's very difficult to prove manipulation. The higher the float of a stock, the more demand it will take to move the stock. if the /WSB group was more focused, they could be targeting low float stocks on a regular basis, moving in and out of them as a herd. It's hard to determine where the manipulation begins and ends. In the end, however, there are always those who caught on late, and end up with losses. The WSB bag holders, those behind the Wendy's dumpster or someone other than your wife's boyfriend. Insert your own WSB colloquialism here.\n\nThis is how stocks move up, down, go to the moon, crash and burn, etc. etc. taking traders along for the euphoric or painful ride. Obviously, in most situations, stocks trade via normal supply and demand as a result to their business model success, events, earnings, etc. Where /WSB started losing its teeth is when they started deemphasizing Sh!t stocks with low floats and decided to start tracking larger float quality names. The supply/demand model still plays out, but with less volatility due to the size of float in most of these stocks. High float, more demand needed to move the stock, less volatility.\n\n**My Single Best Trade**\n\nI have a long, maybe even storied, history in the markets. From full-on day trader back in the 90s and early 2000's to today. Back in mid 2020, I started accumulating a small marijuana stock by the name of Tilray ($TLRY), partly because we were in an election year and the republicans held office, there was continuing interest in marijuana legalization (I have never even tried the stuff), and I was starting to see more and more forum interest on the name, especially on /WSB.\n\nTLRY had a lower float, was gaining in popularity and there were other catalysts that I felt made it a worthwhile swing trade, maybe even a long term hold if legalization efforts broadened, the model worked and TLRY became very profitable.\n\nMaking a long story short, I started a two-phase position by a risk-weighted multiple-thousand share position between $4-$5/share in mid 2020. The stock was percolating but not moving materially for any length of time. After one particular volume spike, followed by a quick rise in price, the stock swelled to $7 but fell quickly back to $5. But what I noticed was the volume, /WSB mention and that price spike. When the stock settled again, volume was back to normal. Deciding to trade around my long shares, I started accumulating $5 leap (long dated) calls. What followed were events that I could not have accurately predicted. The democrats ended up in office, helping all pot stocks. TLRY's model was gaining favor as one of the largest producers. But what really took the top off was that /WSB erupted in all things TLRY for about a two week period beginning in Feb. 2021. The rise leading up to the spike was good, taking the stock to $20 and I peeled off some shares and even some of the calls to protect profits, leaving most of the position in place. The the day or two that followed, the stock erupted from $20, to an intraday price of more than $70. Fear and Greed in my own head kicked in and I waited and watched, eventually deciding to pull the trigger on the entire position around $60 as the stock started falling. I exited the entire position between $55-$60.\n\nChart for this time period is below.\n\n[TLRY - 6 mos. Chart](https://preview.redd.it/m38wqe3wgqvd1.png?width=1601&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2fd3997fa22676b05c83ca973be9bb4435236c4)\n\nThe % gain on the position was massive, both in liquidation of the long shares and, especially the Calls. In this case, my prudence still limited the gain to a % of what it could have been because I am never willing to allow a speculative position to occupy too heavy a weight due to risk management. It's fun to dream what this trade could have yielded if I was a true WSB degenerate but it was still quite sizable and material to the overall account. For relation, even as a right-sized speculation weight, the gain from this single trade boosted the account value by more than 25%, in a tax-advantaged account.\n\nTLRY is now back to $1.50 per share. It's model continues to erode. The fervor is gone but the potential remains simply due to history. TLRY is also a perfect example of one of my Phoenix trades (you can search for that on this sub). At one point in the past, TLRY spiked to $300. That is an important aspect to a phoenix trade.\n\nThis is how speculation can work but, in most cases, it does not. Traders chase profits like these but a vast majority of time it ends in fire and flames, bag holders and loss porn. Sometimes a big gain is the worst thing an individual can have. Those without discipline to understand fear, greed and gambling are lined up for a trip to complete ruin. I never tried to recreate this trade though I still dabble in right-sized speculation ($SOUN) on the potential. Keep positions very low in % and very few in number.\n\nLightning can strike but do yourself a favor and never expect and, if it does strike, don't expect it to strike again in the same place.\n\nLearn to look at \"float\" for an opportunity for long term gains. Low float stocks with good business models can split, increasing your shares and leading to incredible profits. You only need one $AAPL, $MSFT, $NVDA, $NFLX, $CSCO, $META, $GOOGL to go to the moon and take your net worth with it.

With its powerful specs, improved controller, and game-changing features, early reviews are pouring in. Here's a breakdown of what users and critics are saying about this next-gen gaming powerhouse.\n\n# 1.\u00a0Performance: A Gaming Beast\n\nOne of the most talked-about aspects of the new Xbox is its sheer performance. Equipped with a custom AMD processor, the console promises lightning-fast load times and seamless gameplay, even in the most graphically demanding titles. Users have noted how smooth the experience feels, particularly with games running at 120 FPS and the enhanced support for 4K resolution. Many are impressed by the speed of the SSD, which drastically cuts down load times, keeping players in the action longer.\n\n*Verdict: 9/10 \u2014 A leap forward in performance, setting new standards for home consoles.*\n\n# 2.\u00a0Backward Compatibility: A Huge Win\n\nOne feature that has gained the Xbox a lot of positive reviews is its backward compatibility. Gamers who have amassed large libraries of Xbox One and even Xbox 360 games can play them on the new console without a hitch. Even better, older games are enhanced to take advantage of the new hardware, offering improved frame rates and better resolution.\n\n*Verdict: 8.5/10 \u2014 Seamless backward compatibility gives new life to classic titles.*\n\n# 3.\u00a0Design: A Sleek Yet Functional Look\n\nThe design of the new Xbox is a departure from previous models, opting for a minimalist, monolithic shape. While some users appreciate the sleek, modern aesthetic that blends well with home entertainment setups, others have mentioned its size as a potential issue, depending on their space.\n\nThe console is quiet, even during long gaming sessions, thanks to its innovative cooling system, which ensures it runs efficiently without generating much noise.\n\n*Verdict: 7.5/10 \u2014 A bold, futuristic design, though some users may need to rearrange their setups to accommodate its size.*\n\n# 4.\u00a0Controller: Refining a Classic\n\nThe Xbox controller has long been a fan favorite, and the new version makes subtle yet effective improvements. The grip feels more comfortable, the triggers have been fine-tuned for better feedback, and the share button is a welcome addition for streamers and content creators. However, some have noted that, while great, it doesn\u2019t feel like a major leap compared to its predecessor.\n\n*Verdict: 8/10 \u2014 A refined, comfortable controller, though not a massive upgrade.*\n\n# 5.\u00a0Game Library: Promising, But Needs More Exclusives\n\nWhile the new Xbox supports a vast range of third-party titles and backward-compatible games, some critics have pointed out that the launch lineup lacks the exclusive games that traditionally drive console sales. Games like\u00a0*Halo Infinite*\u00a0are highly anticipated, but delays have left some fans feeling like the library could be stronger.\n\nThat being said, Game Pass continues to be a major selling point. With access to hundreds of games from day one, including new releases, it remains one of the best deals in gaming.\n\n*Verdict: 7/10 \u2014 A solid game library bolstered by Game Pass, but some exclusive titles are missing at launch.*\n\n# 6.\u00a0Future-Proofing: Ready for the Next Generation\n\nAnother standout feature is the console\u2019s future-proof design. With support for 8K resolution, ray tracing, and 120Hz refresh rates, the new Xbox is clearly designed to last for years to come. This is an exciting prospect for gamers who want to invest in a console that will remain relevant as technology continues to advance.\n\n*Verdict: 9/10 \u2014 Built for the future, ensuring longevity in a rapidly evolving market.*\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe new Xbox console has impressed critics and gamers alike with its high-end performance, backward compatibility, and refined controller design. However, the launch lineup could benefit from more exclusives, and its bold design might not suit every space. Nevertheless, with Game Pass providing endless hours of entertainment and the promise of future titles, this console is a solid choice for gamers looking for next-gen power and performance.\n\n*Overall Verdict: 8.5/10 \u2014 A powerful and future-ready console with a few areas for improvement, but an undeniable win for Xbox fans.*The New Xbox Console: Reviews and First Impressions\n\n[TV LAVIN: The New Xbox Console: Reviews and First Impressions](https://tvlavin.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-new-xbox-console-reviews-and-first.html)"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "AMZN", "page_content": {"title": "Los 10 mejores productos de graviola disponibles en Amazon.", "content": "# \n\n\u00a0La graviola, tambi\u00e9n conocida como guan\u00e1bana, es una fruta tropical conocida por sus propiedades medicinales y antioxidantes.

Este fruto ha sido utilizado tradicionalmente en la medicina natural para tratar una amplia variedad de enfermedades, desde infecciones hasta problemas digestivos. Sin embargo, lo que ha capturado mayor atenci\u00f3n en a\u00f1os recientes es su potencial como tratamiento complementario para combatir el c\u00e1ncer.\n\n# Composici\u00f3n y Propiedades de la Graviola\n\nLa graviola es rica en compuestos bioactivos, principalmente acetogeninas de annon\u00e1ceas, que se han identificado como los componentes m\u00e1s potentes contra las c\u00e9lulas cancer\u00edgenas. Estos compuestos tienen la capacidad de inhibir la producci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda en las mitocondrias de las c\u00e9lulas malignas, lo que provoca su muerte sin afectar gravemente a las c\u00e9lulas sanas . Adem\u00e1s de las acetogeninas, la graviola contiene antioxidantes, vitaminas (como la vitamina C), minerales (calcio, magnesio y potasio) y fibra, lo que la convierte en un excelente refuerzo para el sistema inmunol\u00f3gico.\n\n# Beneficios para la Salud\n\n1. **Efecto Anticancer\u00edgeno**: Diversos estudios en laboratorios han mostrado que los extractos de graviola son eficaces para inhibir el crecimiento de c\u00e9lulas cancerosas en varios tipos de c\u00e1ncer, incluyendo el c\u00e1ncer de mama, colon, pr\u00f3stata y pulm\u00f3n. Las acetogeninas, como mencionamos antes, son los compuestos clave, ya que bloquean selectivamente las c\u00e9lulas malignas, impidiendo su reproducci\u00f3n.Un estudio publicado por el\u00a0*Journal of Natural Products*\u00a0destac\u00f3 que las acetogeninas de la graviola son entre 10,000 y 10,000 veces m\u00e1s efectivas que la quimioterapia convencional, sin los efectos secundarios debilitantes que suelen asociarse a este tratamiento . Sin embargo, es importante se\u00f1alar que la mayor\u00eda de estos estudios se han realizado en entornos de laboratorio, y a\u00fan falta m\u00e1s investigaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica en humanos para confirmar su eficacia total .\n2. **Propiedades Antioxidantes**: Los antioxidantes presentes en la graviola ayudan a combatir el estr\u00e9s oxidativo, que est\u00e1 relacionado con el envejecimiento prematuro y el desarrollo de enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas, incluido el c\u00e1ncer. Los antioxidantes neutralizan los radicales libres en el cuerpo, lo que contribuye a la protecci\u00f3n de las c\u00e9lulas .\n3. **Sistema Inmunol\u00f3gico**: La alta concentraci\u00f3n de vitamina C en la graviola refuerza el sistema inmunol\u00f3gico, ayudando al cuerpo a combatir infecciones y otras enfermedades. Un sistema inmunol\u00f3gico fuerte es esencial para prevenir la aparici\u00f3n de enfermedades, incluido el c\u00e1ncer .\n4. **Propiedades Anti-inflamatorias y Analg\u00e9sicas**: La graviola ha sido utilizada en la medicina tradicional para tratar dolencias como la inflamaci\u00f3n y el dolor cr\u00f3nico . Estas propiedades la convierten en un aliado para pacientes con c\u00e1ncer que buscan alivio de los efectos secundarios de los tratamientos convencionales.\n5. **Salud Digestiva y Antimicrobiana**: La graviola es conocida por sus efectos beneficiosos sobre el sistema digestivo, ayudando a combatir infecciones bacterianas, par\u00e1sitos y hongos . Adem\u00e1s, sus propiedades antimicrobianas pueden proteger al organismo durante momentos de debilidad, como durante el tratamiento del c\u00e1ncer.\n\n# \u00bfC\u00f3mo se Consume la Graviola?\n\nLa graviola se puede consumir de varias formas:\n\n* **Fruta fresca**: Se puede comer directamente la pulpa de la fruta, que tiene un sabor dulce y \u00e1cido.\n* **T\u00e9 de hojas de graviola**: Las hojas de graviola se han utilizado tradicionalmente para hacer t\u00e9, conocido por sus efectos calmantes y medicinales .\n* **Suplementos**: Existen c\u00e1psulas y extractos concentrados de graviola disponibles en tiendas de productos naturales y herbolarios.\n\nSe recomienda consultar a un m\u00e9dico antes de comenzar a consumir graviola, especialmente si se est\u00e1 bajo tratamiento m\u00e9dico, ya que puede haber interacciones con medicamentos .\n\n# Consideraciones Finales\n\nAunque la graviola muestra un gran potencial como tratamiento complementario en la lucha contra el c\u00e1ncer, es esencial recordar que no debe reemplazar los tratamientos m\u00e9dicos convencionales. Los estudios en humanos son limitados, y el uso de la graviola debe ser supervisado por un profesional de la salud. A\u00fan as\u00ed, su uso como apoyo a los tratamientos convencionales, junto con una dieta equilibrada y un estilo de vida saludable, puede proporcionar m\u00faltiples beneficios para la salud.\n\nLa graviola, con su impresionante perfil de nutrientes y compuestos bioactivos, sigue captando la atenci\u00f3n de la ciencia moderna. Su posible papel en la prevenci\u00f3n y tratamiento del c\u00e1ncer es solo una de las muchas razones por las que esta fruta tropical merece un lugar destacado en nuestra alimentaci\u00f3n y en la investigaci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica futura.\n\n\n\n\n\n[TV LAVIN: Graviola: La Fruta Milagrosa y sus Propiedades Curativas, Especialmente contra el C\u00e1ncer](https://tvlavin.blogspot.com/2024/10/graviola-la-fruta-milagrosa-y-sus.html)\n\n# \n\n\u00a0"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "AMZN", "page_content": {"title": "Los 10 mejores productos de graviola disponibles en Amazon.", "content": "# \n\n\u00a0La graviola, tambi\u00e9n conocida como guan\u00e1bana, es una fruta tropical conocida por sus propiedades medicinales y antioxidantes.

Lived in Europe and in America as a child. Moved around the US often as an adult. Started life in middle class, always had the basics like shelter, food, healthcare, although both parents came from slightly above poverty households. Family not particularly close, after 16 it felt like I was emancipated and have been on my own ever since. My life goals at 18 were to have a car, apartment and make $35K/yr which was enough for the \u201cgood life\u201d in the LCOL area. Relationship wise I want a life partner but have zero desire for children.\n\n**CAREER**. Tech exec with $980K annual comp. Multiple STEM degrees, technical certifications, business degree and certifications. First half of my career was in a \u201c*boring industry*\u201d, switched to tech and never looked back. Stayed around emerging (new) technologies as I knew with limited experience I could get paid top dollar.\n\n**RELATIONSHIP WITH MONEY**. It\u2019s toxic AF \u263a\ufe0f\u2026seriously, through listening, research and therapy I realized I equate money to safety. Most of my life I\u2019ve had zero support and needed to save money to take care of myself and child or else I felt I\u2019d be out on the street homeless. The environment I came from felt unsafe (e.g. held at gunpoint as a teenager) so the idea of no money, on the streets homeless and a lack of ability to keep myself safe was frightening and not something I would let happen. This emotional state stayed with me through making hundreds of thousands of dollars resulting in comparatively small spending vs my pay as I needed to save it all or else I\u2019d be homeless or destitute, even when making hundreds of thousands with less than $100K in annual expenses.\n\n**FIRE INTRODUCTION**. I originally hated FIRE as everyone thought I jumped on a FIRE bandwagon although I\u2019ve been planning for early retirement since 17. I watched a few FIRE people on YouTube, which made me want to further stay away from the group as they seem like sleezeballs and not knowledgeable. Eventually I got exposed to the right communities and found people in similar situations to me, with more knowledge than me across various topics (e.g. taxes) and felt the portion of the FIRE community I engaged with is an asset and accelerated my growth. I can\u2019t overstate how important it was to have others in a similar situation as me that I could ask questions to for navigating a unique, somewhat taboo situation. The reason I\u2019m sharing in the event it helps someone else.\n\n**DECISION TO RETIRE**. I made a plan at 17 to retire early at 45 as I rationalized \u201ceveryone hates their jobs, might as well save up a lot of money and escape that hell sooner than later.\u201d I realize now the negative viewpoint was driven by the adults in my life that I saw not enjoying work. This viewpoint also stayed with me throughout my career, probably allowing me to suffer and deal with more shit because I expected work to be bad. More bad stuff I deAlt with (vs just complaining) the higher I rose. This thought process broke for me when I was making $1M/yr at $1T company. There were three people between me and the CEO and I did not envy or want any of their jobs. I saw people lose their family members and could only take off one day to mourn over a three-day weekend because they were a busy, important executive and couldn\u2019t step away. Another guy literally had a broken back and was in meetings slouched over a chair versus recovering. One person looked like at any given moment, they would have a stroke and die. Their eyes were always twitching and they had pretty bad health. I asked myself, if they are making way more than $1M a year and have a high net worth but can\u2019t prioritize their health or family any more than someone working a low-level factory job, what is the use? At the same time I found all the sacrifices I made to get to the top were now extremely difficult if not impossible. Once I had FI, for lack of better words, I gave no fucks. I actually loved to work and shaping industries for emerging technologies but hated the political nature which was the primary part of my role as an exec, not the technology. Work became no fun and not necessary so I decided to retire, although it took a lot of emotional turmoil to get to the point of pulling the trigger. Almost as soon as I decided I no longer need to work for money, my dream company came along and offered me a job at $2M/year. I LoL\u2019d, thought the universe was really trying to test my resolve and declined the role.\n\n**FIRE TARGET**. This was a continually moving goal, and not for practical reasons. As mentioned, money is security for me so the more neurotic I got the larger the FIRE number I needed to feel secure. It didn\u2019t help to have many coworkers that were multimillionaires telling me anything under $5M net worth is the equivalent of being in poverty and I shouldn\u2019t stop until at least $15M. Ironically, these people were at or past those numbers and still mostly unhappy. Also my 90% safe SWR is 4.84% (not 4%) and my bulletproof SWR is 4.04% (not 3.25%). My original FIRE target was $10K/mo or $2.5M. That number changed at some point to $5M but then got back to where I settled which was $2.7M. At $2.7M or $11K/mo I was no longer trading off time for money.\n\n**RETIREMENT BUDGET**. Before retiring my spend was roughly $7K/mo or $84K/year. In a MCOL city I stayed in a luxury high-rise ($2,700), drove a luxury vehicle ($1,100), had a healthy food budget ($1,750), got regular massages ($400) and had disposable income ($1,000+) left over. That is in addition to investing the majority of my income. My retirement budget differs in the fact that I will no longer be living in the US, which winds up being cheaper (e.g. health insurance) for a better quality of life. Of the places I\u2019ve looked at, either $5K/mo (e.g. SE Asia, LATAM) or $8K/mo (e.g. Europe, Middle East) was enough to live an upper class life (#ChubbyFire). Actual expenses below for two MCOL cities, one in the US (as backup) and my international destination.\n\n**Budget A (International |**  $6,700 Total**)**\n\n* Rent: $3,500\n* Transportation: $400 (private driver, Lexus)\n* Food: $1,500\n* Insurance: $400\n* Gym: $200\n* Massage: $400\n* Misc: $300\n\n**Budget B (US |** $8,800 Total**)**\n\n* $1,500 BMW i4\n* $1,750 Food\n* $3,750 Luxury High-rise premier zipcode\n* $850 Insurance\n* $300 Misc bills, subscriptions\n* $400 Massages\n* $250 Gym\n\n**PORTFOLIO**. Breakout of $3.4M NW.\n\n* **HYSA**: $651K - all from a recent influx of cash. To protect both of us it\u2019s better I don\u2019t disclose how and you don\u2019t ask \ud83d\ude09. Will most likely invest $500K of this, but still determining where. Currently sits in Vanguard Federal (VMFXX).\n* **Bank**: $8K - random transactional cash. Try to keep this at $20K or less.\n* **Crypto**: $235K - started at $70K, got up to $450K. Will sell next time it hits $400K+\n* **Investment (post-tax)**: $2,415K - Includes VTSAX, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, KO, AMD, QCOM. Most of the money is in VTSAX, periodically I got hundred thousand dollar bonuses and go into an individual stock if I saw they were significantly undervalued and I knew enough about the industry to make a relevant call on the stock\u2019s value (e.g. picking tech vs healthcare companies).\n* **Investment (pre-tax)**: $100K - 401(k). Used sparingly as I knew I didn\u2019t want money tied in an account I didn\u2019t have access to until late 60s which also incurs early withdrawal tax penalties. 100% of the retirement is a VTSAX equivalent.\u00a0\n\n$3.4M total. 4.84% SWR: $13,713/mo. Left Over After Expenses: $7K/mo\u00a0 (internationally) and $5K/mo (US).\n\n**SWR PHILOSOPHY**: As mentioned, my relationship with money was driven by fear/insecurity/generally bad stuff. This impacted my SWR by making me pick the lowest possible percentage that was \u201cguaranteed\u201d to be safe. As I\u2019ve matured closer to retirement, I realize there is no guarantees. I also believe that retiring is not a one-way door, meaning I am retiring from trading my time for money but can return whenever I\u2019d like (albeit for less pay). I also don\u2019t think FIRE equates to not generating money ever again in life. I believe it almost impossible to not generate money ever again as I\u2019m entrepreneurial minded. I\u2019ll now just be doing things for myself and out of enjoyment versus to monetize. I also have the luxury of only needing a SWR of 2.4% to cover all my expenses. Each month I will try to \u201cspend up to\u201d the 4.84% which admittedly will be a struggle but I\u2019m committed to it post reading Die With Zero. The \u201cspend up to\u201d SWR philosophy helps in at least two ways. **1**) If my portfolio gets cut in half and spending gets cut in half, my core lifestyle doesn\u2019t change. I\u2019ve always lived on a fraction of my income so living below my means is easy, living at my means is the hard part. **2**) The ability to significantly cut expenses each month is one of the better safety mechanisms in retirement. There are calculators online that allow you to put in monthly spend fluctuation. The bigger the adjustment you\u2019re able to make, you can either withdraw more money or have a higher probability of success with the same amount of money. I don\u2019t want more money, as I\u2019m struggling to spend what I have but I do want the increased probability of staying successfully retired.\n\n**DEBT**. I have none. No car payment, house payment, student loans, credit card bills, etc.\n\n**TAXES**. I don\u2019t normally factor these in. I expect to take around $120K/yr which I get a standard deduction of $20K and the first $40K/year in capital gains are tax free. As example, taking out $120K, $90K of it is taxable ($30K is the OG investment) and I\u2019d pay 15% or $4.5K ($90K minus $60K tax exempt portion) or $375/mo in taxes. The low effective tax doesn\u2019t change much if I go from $120K to a $165K withdrawal, and as I live well below my top monthly SWR taxes at these levels are negligible.\n\n**ADVICE (recommendations).** Primary advice I\u2019d give below\u2026\n\n1. **Prioritize Health & Relationships**. It\u2019s the most important thing. You can have money but not your health and probably aren\u2019t going to enjoy life. To get to a multimillionaire status before the age of 40 you will probably have to prioritize work/wealth generation over a lot of things, but I don\u2019t recommend consistently prioritizing work over your health and family/relationships. Both can make you spiritually rich and help you become financially rich.\n2. \u00a0**Find Internal Validation**. One of the hardest parts about retiring is losing the validation I got through work. Making $1 million a year, having a nice title, getting access to things others didn\u2019t as I was an executive, etc. all went to my head. Not immediately, not even noticeably but eventually. If most or all of your validation comes from the company you\u2019re at, the work you do and the money you\u2019re getting paid then retiring will be very difficult, regardless of how much money you have. I\u2019ve seen many people post, \u201c*I\u2019m 60, have $XM NW and my health is failing me, I hate my job but don\u2019t know what else to do. I have no friends, personal life, hobbies so I just stay working\u2026*\u201d I\u2019ve never been in this state but do feel for these people. You can avoid the negative state by being able to self validate, which is important for something like FIRE. You are in a unique situation, you\u2019re doing things the average person will never do so you\u2019re not going to get validation from the masses. If anything you\u2019re going to get told the opposite: \u201cdon\u2019t do it, you\u2019re foolish, it\u2019ll never work, why are you wasting your time?\u201d If you can make a decision, do the research and draw a logical conclusion and stick to that you will have a better FIRE experience. Same is true with the need for Reddit validation (e.g. \u201cI read your plan, love it! I\u2019m rooting for you and everyone else does plans like these and they always succeeded, you\u2019ll be fine!\u201d).\n3. **Avoid Financial Neurosis**. Most of western society is focused on overindulgence and mass consumption at the cost of being in debt, slave to corporations, declining mental and physical health, etc. While it was very clear to me spending compulsively is unhealthy, it took a long time to realize my relationship of saving compulsively was unhealthy too. With money I was the equivalent of one of these reality TV show hoarders, well past being an efficient saver because of all of the negative emotions associated with my relationship with money. I see post after post that reads something along the lines of, \u201c*I am unhappy, hate my job, have struggling relationships, my health is failing me and I have $XM NW, can I retire? I\u2019m afraid to\u2026*\u201d That kind of attachment to money/work is unhealthy to me. While I\u2019ve benefited from it, as corporate America rewards and is built on people that think like this, I\u2019ve also suffered from it. I pray others focus on their relationship with money, maintaining a healthy balance and setting appropriate boundaries.\n4. **Use Lifestyle Arbitrage**. As I worked in tech, many friends/associates live in HCOL areas across the West Coast. My $90K/yr MCOL budget was $200K/yr for them for the same lifestyle. For people currently struggling with jobs they hate or who don\u2019t want to have a large FIRE number to support living in a HCOL city, move to a L/MCOL city. For example $1.5M FIRE number ($6K/mo) gives you a good to great life in Lisbon, Mexico City, Bangkok, Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona and many cities across the US. At $2.5M ($10K/mo) I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable living in a HCOL city like NY or San Francisco where at $100K you can still apply for government assistance as you are considered at the poverty line. If you are unhappy, unhealthy, and can retire earlier and it just requires moving\u2026then move.\u00a0\n\n**WHAT\u2019S NEXT**. Another reason I decided to retire was work was getting in the way. I had a lot of hobbies and could not explore them fully. This allowed me to \u201cretire to something\u201d vs \u201cretire from something\u201d which is the difference of running to something you enjoy vs running away from something you hate (former creates better mental health). I enjoy creating which manifest in music and film production, writing short stories and scripts and I\u2019ve written a book. I also like to travel, workout, play sports, attend live sporting events, live music events, plays/theater, watch TV shows, movies, play video games, read, some lounges/parties, etc. I plan to explore these hobbies fully and do things I never got to do (e.g. skiing) while I still have the physical health to do so. In addition to tech, I\u2019ve also worked as a college professor at some top universities. I\u2019m offered up to $1,500 per hour for consulting. Originally, when I planned to retire, I said that I would do both of these things but now I can see I was making the decision from a bad place mentally. I found I need to retire, take some time off of work to just relax and be, then make a decision on what I want to do next. A friend group who retired early from selling a startup told me they had plans on what they would do when they got the money, but it came from their overworked corporate mind which could rationalize spending time consulting or doing some modification of their existing work (not truly stepping away). When they did retire, as example, one guy who was going to consult wound up being a substitute teacher. When I asked him why he said, he never planned on it but realize after FIRE that substitution was one of the few jobs he could have which didn\u2019t require him to work every day and didn\u2019t require him to miss taking his kids to and from school as he works during their school hours. So I too am leaving the space open to allow myself to formulate what I want to do next.\u00a0\n\nAnd that\u2019s all I can think of.

The \u201cspend up to\u201d SWR philosophy helps in at least two ways. **1**) If my portfolio gets cut in half and spending gets cut in half, my core lifestyle doesn\u2019t change. I\u2019ve always lived on a fraction of my income so living below my means is easy, living at my means is the hard part. **2**) The ability to significantly cut expenses each month is one of the better safety mechanisms in retirement. There are calculators online that allow you to put in monthly spend fluctuation. The bigger the adjustment you\u2019re able to make, you can either withdraw more money or have a higher probability of success with the same amount of money. I don\u2019t want more money, as I\u2019m struggling to spend what I have but I do want the increased probability of staying successfully retired.\n\n**DEBT**. I have none. No car payment, house payment, student loans, credit card bills, etc.\n\n**TAXES**. I don\u2019t normally factor these in. I expect to take around $120K/yr which I get a standard deduction of $20K and the first $40K/year in capital gains are tax free. As example, taking out $120K, $90K of it is taxable ($30K is the OG investment) and I\u2019d pay 15% or $4.5K ($90K minus $60K tax exempt portion) or $375/mo in taxes. The low effective tax doesn\u2019t change much if I go from $120K to a $165K withdrawal, and as I live well below my top monthly SWR taxes at these levels are negligible.\n\n**ADVICE (recommendations).** Primary advice I\u2019d give below\u2026\n\n1. **Prioritize Health & Relationships**. It\u2019s the most important thing. You can have money but not your health and probably aren\u2019t going to enjoy life. To get to a multimillionaire status before the age of 40 you will probably have to prioritize work/wealth generation over a lot of things, but I don\u2019t recommend consistently prioritizing work over your health and family/relationships. Both can make you spiritually rich and help you become financially rich.\n2. \u00a0**Find Internal Validation**. One of the hardest parts about retiring is losing the validation I got through work. Making $1 million a year, having a nice title, getting access to things others didn\u2019t as I was an executive, etc. all went to my head. Not immediately, not even noticeably but eventually. If most or all of your validation comes from the company you\u2019re at, the work you do and the money you\u2019re getting paid then retiring will be very difficult, regardless of how much money you have. I\u2019ve seen many people post, \u201c*I\u2019m 60, have $XM NW and my health is failing me, I hate my job but don\u2019t know what else to do. I have no friends, personal life, hobbies so I just stay working\u2026*\u201d I\u2019ve never been in this state but do feel for these people. You can avoid the negative state by being able to self validate, which is important for something like FIRE. You are in a unique situation, you\u2019re doing things the average person will never do so you\u2019re not going to get validation from the masses. If anything you\u2019re going to get told the opposite: \u201cdon\u2019t do it, you\u2019re foolish, it\u2019ll never work, why are you wasting your time?\u201d If you can make a decision, do the research and draw a logical conclusion and stick to that you will have a better FIRE experience. Same is true with the need for Reddit validation (e.g. \u201cI read your plan, love it! I\u2019m rooting for you and everyone else does plans like these and they always succeeded, you\u2019ll be fine!\u201d).\n3. **Avoid Financial Neurosis**. Most of western society is focused on overindulgence and mass consumption at the cost of being in debt, slave to corporations, declining mental and physical health, etc. While it was very clear to me spending compulsively is unhealthy, it took a long time to realize my relationship of saving compulsively was unhealthy too. With money I was the equivalent of one of these reality TV show hoarders, well past being an efficient saver because of all of the negative emotions associated with my relationship with money. I see post after post that reads something along the lines of, \u201c*I am unhappy, hate my job, have struggling relationships, my health is failing me and I have $XM NW, can I retire? I\u2019m afraid to\u2026*\u201d That kind of attachment to money/work is unhealthy to me. While I\u2019ve benefited from it, as corporate America rewards and is built on people that think like this, I\u2019ve also suffered from it. I pray others focus on their relationship with money, maintaining a healthy balance and setting appropriate boundaries.\n4. **Use Lifestyle Arbitrage**. As I worked in tech, many friends/associates live in HCOL areas across the West Coast. My $90K/yr MCOL budget was $200K/yr for them for the same lifestyle. For people currently struggling with jobs they hate or who don\u2019t want to have a large FIRE number to support living in a HCOL city, move to a L/MCOL city. For example $1.5M FIRE number ($6K/mo) gives you a good to great life in Lisbon, Mexico City, Bangkok, Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona and many cities across the US. At $2.5M ($10K/mo) I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable living in a HCOL city like NY or San Francisco where at $100K you can still apply for government assistance as you are considered at the poverty line. If you are unhappy, unhealthy, and can retire earlier and it just requires moving\u2026then move.\u00a0\n\n**WHAT\u2019S NEXT**. Another reason I decided to retire was work was getting in the way. I had a lot of hobbies and could not explore them fully. This allowed me to \u201cretire to something\u201d vs \u201cretire from something\u201d which is the difference of running to something you enjoy vs running away from something you hate (former creates better mental health). I enjoy creating which manifest in music and film production, writing short stories and scripts and I\u2019ve written a book. I also like to travel, workout, play sports, attend live sporting events, live music events, plays/theater, watch TV shows, movies, play video games, read, some lounges/parties, etc. I plan to explore these hobbies fully and do things I never got to do (e.g. skiing) while I still have the physical health to do so. In addition to tech, I\u2019ve also worked as a college professor at some top universities. I\u2019m offered up to $1,500 per hour for consulting. Originally, when I planned to retire, I said that I would do both of these things but now I can see I was making the decision from a bad place mentally. I found I need to retire, take some time off of work to just relax and be, then make a decision on what I want to do next. A friend group who retired early from selling a startup told me they had plans on what they would do when they got the money, but it came from their overworked corporate mind which could rationalize spending time consulting or doing some modification of their existing work (not truly stepping away). When they did retire, as example, one guy who was going to consult wound up being a substitute teacher. When I asked him why he said, he never planned on it but realize after FIRE that substitution was one of the few jobs he could have which didn\u2019t require him to work every day and didn\u2019t require him to miss taking his kids to and from school as he works during their school hours. So I too am leaving the space open to allow myself to formulate what I want to do next.\u00a0\n\nAnd that\u2019s all I can think of. Hope this helps. \ud83d\ude0e\u270c\ud83c\udffe\n\nLet me know if you have any FIRE related questions to the above content (not interested in giving career advice, diving into personal non-FIRE topics, etc).

If you\u2019re hiking, trekking, or biking, you\u2019ll want a\u00a0**travel backpack**\u00a0that feels like a natural extension of your body, rather than a burden.\n\n* **Adjustability:**\u00a0The more adjustable the straps, the better the fit.\n* **Padding:**\u00a0Padded straps help reduce strain on your shoulders and back.\n* **Breathable Material:**\u00a0Mesh back panels can prevent sweat buildup, keeping you cool.\n\n# 2. Durability and Weather Resistance\n\nOutdoor adventures often involve unpredictable weather, so a\u00a0**best travel backpack**\u00a0for sporty travelers should be made from durable, water-resistant material. Look for backpacks made from materials like nylon or polyester that can withstand abrasions and moisture. Some backpacks come with a built-in rain cover, which is a huge plus if you expect wet conditions.\n\n* **Water Resistance:**\u00a0Even if you don\u2019t plan on getting caught in the rain, it\u2019s better to be prepared.\n* **Durable Zippers:**\u00a0Strong, smooth zippers are a must for keeping your belongings safe.\n\n# 3. Storage and Organization\n\nA well-organized\u00a0**travel backpack**\u00a0will have multiple compartments and pockets to store everything from your water bottle to your passport. For sporty travelers, hydration compartments, quick-access pockets, and compression straps are incredibly useful. A travel backpack with a separate shoe compartment is ideal for keeping dirty shoes away from clean clothes.\n\n* **Multiple Compartments:**\u00a0Keeps gear organized and easy to find.\n* **Laptop Sleeve:**\u00a0Even sporty travelers might need to bring a laptop or tablet.\n* **Hydration Compatibility:**\u00a0Some backpacks have compartments for hydration bladders, making it easy to drink on the go.\n\n# 4. Size and Weight\n\nWhen choosing the\u00a0**best backpack for travel**, you\u2019ll want to consider the size. The volume of a travel backpack is typically measured in liters, with 30\u201350L being ideal for short to medium trips. If you\u2019re traveling for more than a week, you might want something larger. However, don\u2019t forget to factor in the weight of the backpack itself. A lighter backpack makes it easier to carry heavy gear without adding unnecessary strain.\n\n* **Volume:**\u00a0Choose a size that suits your travel needs. 40L is a versatile choice for most sporty travelers.\n* **Weight:**\u00a0A lightweight yet sturdy backpack is key for long days on the move.\n\n# Best Travel Backpacks for Sporty Women\n\nWhen it comes to finding the\u00a0**best travel backpack for women**, it\u2019s important to look for something that\u2019s designed with a woman\u2019s frame in mind. Women\u2019s backpacks often have shorter torso lengths, narrower shoulder straps, and offer more lumbar support.\n\n# 1. Osprey Fairview 40\n\nThe\u00a0[Osprey Fairview 40](https://amzn.to/3BXS0eq)\u00a0is consistently rated as one of the\u00a0**best travel backpacks for women**. It\u2019s carry-on sized, so no need to check it in, and its comfortable suspension system makes it great for sporty travelers who might be walking long distances or hiking. It\u2019s versatile enough for urban travel yet rugged enough for outdoor adventures. The 40L capacity is ideal for those who pack light but need space for essentials like hiking boots or a rain jacket.\n\n# 2. Deuter ACT Trail 28 SL\n\nThe [Deuter ACT Trail 28 SL](https://amzn.to/4dWX0gF) is a top choice for women who prefer a smaller, sleeker option. It's incredibly comfortable, designed specifically for a woman\u2019s body, with padded straps and a mesh back panel for ventilation. It\u2019s great for sporty travelers who might be exploring mountain trails or bike paths, but also need a functional bag for city travel.\n\n# Best Travel Backpacks for Sporty Men\n\nFor sporty men who need a travel backpack that\u2019s durable, functional, and comfortable, there are several great options available. The\u00a0**best travel backpack for men**\u00a0will have the same features mentioned earlier, but may also include larger capacities and longer straps for those with bigger frames.\n\n# 1. Osprey Farpoint 40\n\nThe\u00a0[Osprey Farpoint 40](https://amzn.to/4h34O3z)\u00a0is often hailed as the\u00a0**best travel backpack for men**\u00a0because of its balance between capacity and comfort. It\u2019s the men\u2019s version of the Fairview, but with a design that fits broader shoulders and longer torsos. Its ruggedness makes it perfect for the outdoors, while the sleek design allows it to transition seamlessly into more urban settings.\n\n# 2. North Face Borealis\n\n[North Face Borealis](https://amzn.to/3AfnM6a)\u00a0For those who want the\u00a0**best travel backpack**\u00a0that\u2019s more geared toward day trips or weekend getaways, the North Face Borealis is a solid choice. It offers a durable design, plenty of pockets, and comes with a 28L capacity that\u2019s more than enough for short adventures. The padded laptop sleeve also makes it a good option for those who work on the go.\n\n# Best General Travel Backpacks for Sporty Travelers\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something more unisex that works for both men and women or if you\u2019re not picky about gender-specific design, here are a few more versatile options that top the list for sporty travelers.\n\n# 1. Patagonia Black Hole 32L\n\n[Patagonia Black Hole 32L](https://amzn.to/3U8cEib)[\u00a0](https://amzn.to/3U8cEib)The Patagonia Black Hole is one of the most durable, weather-resistant backpacks out there, making it perfect for sporty travelers who expect to face tough conditions. The 32L version is ideal for day trips, but the bag comes in larger sizes as well. Its durable fabric can withstand rough handling, and it\u2019s perfect for outdoor activities like hiking or skiing, as well as urban exploration.\n\n# 2.

Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of how to choose the right backpack based on your adventure:\n\n# Hiking and Trekking\n\nLook for a backpack that has a hydration reservoir, a durable frame, and is made from weather-resistant material. Backpacks in the 30\u201350L range work well for hikes.\n\n# City Exploration\n\nFor city travel, you\u2019ll want something sleek, compact, and stylish but still functional. Look for smaller backpacks (20\u201330L) with plenty of compartments for organizing daily essentials.\n\n# Multisport Adventures\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to do multiple activities, like biking, hiking, and city exploration, a versatile backpack like the Osprey Farpoint/Fairview 40 or the Patagonia Black Hole will serve you well.\n\n# \n\nFinding the best\u00a0**travel backpack**\u00a0for sporty travelers requires a balance of comfort, durability, and practicality.

Be Sure of Your Feelings\n\nBefore proposing, make sure you're genuinely interested in her and ready for a relationship. Ask yourself if you\u2019re prepared for the commitment.\n\n# 2. Build a Strong Connection\n\nIf you haven't already, invest time in getting to know her well. Spend time together, talk openly, and build trust. Ensure she feels comfortable with you and there\u2019s mutual respect.\n\n# 3. Pick the Right Moment\n\nTiming matters. Choose a moment when the two of you are relaxed and alone, so you can talk without interruptions. Avoid public or pressured settings unless you're sure she's comfortable with that.\n\n# 4. Express Your Feelings Honestly\n\nBe genuine when telling her how you feel. A simple and heartfelt expression like, \u201cI\u2019ve developed strong feelings for you, and I\u2019d love for us to take things to the next level,\u201d can work wonders. Let her know what makes her special to you.\n\n# 5. Listen to Her Feelings\n\nAfter expressing your feelings, give her space to respond. Respect her feelings, whether they align with yours or not. It's important to have open and honest communication.\n\n# 6. Respect Her Decision\n\nWhether she says yes or no, be respectful of her decision. If she needs time to think about it, give her that space without pressuring her. If she\u2019s not interested, accept it gracefully.\n\n# 7. Be Prepared for Any Outcome\n\nNot every proposal results in a relationship, so be ready for all possibilities. If she feels the same way, celebrate that! If not, handle it maturely and maintain respect.\n\n# Sample Proposal:\n\n\u201cHey \\[her name\\], I\u2019ve really enjoyed the time we\u2019ve spent together, and I feel like we have a strong connection. I\u2019ve started to see you as more than just a friend, and I wanted to be honest about my feelings.

While shedding is natural, excessive hair loss can be concerning. Here are some simple solutions to help manage and reduce your Labrador puppy\u2019s hair fall:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g82vm2vxjuvd1.jpg?width=595&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71ec7389aa98313cf078d68ee10dc16175a1cdbe\n\n# 1. Regular Brushing\n\nOne of the best ways to reduce hair fall is to brush your Labrador puppy regularly. Labradors have a double coat, meaning they shed a lot, especially during shedding seasons (spring and fall). Use a de-[shedding tool](https://amzn.to/3Yw85kG) or a [slicker brush](https://amzn.to/4dSfNtI) to remove loose hair and prevent it from ending up all over your house.\n\n* **Tip:** Brush your Labrador at least 2-3 times a week to keep shedding under control. During heavy shedding periods, you may need to brush them daily.\n* Best shedding tool [buy now Check-in link](https://amzn.to/3Yw85kG)/[slicker brush ](https://amzn.to/4dSfNtI)\n\n# 2. Balanced Diet\n\nA healthy diet plays a big role in keeping your puppy\u2019s coat healthy. Ensure your Labrador puppy is eating a well-balanced, high-quality diet rich in Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids. These nutrients help maintain healthy skin and coat, reducing hair fall.\n\n* **Tip:** Include fish oil supplements or foods like salmon, flaxseeds, and chia seeds in your puppy's diet to boost their coat health.\n* best [fish oil omega 3 for dogs check-in ](https://amzn.to/4faG47t)\n\n# 3. Regular Bathing\n\nGiving your Labrador puppy a bath every 4-6 weeks can help remove loose hair and keep their skin clean. Use a gentle, dog-specific shampoo that doesn\u2019t dry out their skin, as dry skin can lead to more hair loss.\n\n* **Tip:** Avoid over-bathing, as it can strip the natural oils from your puppy\u2019s skin, leading to more shedding.\n\n# 4. Hydration\n\nDehydration can cause dry skin and lead to increased shedding. Make sure your Labrador puppy always has access to fresh water. Keeping them hydrated promotes healthy skin and coat, which reduces hair fall.\n\n* **Tip:** Monitor your puppy\u2019s water intake, especially in hot weather or after exercise.\n\n# 5. Manage Stress\n\nJust like humans, puppies can experience stress, and stress can sometimes lead to excessive shedding. Ensure your Labrador puppy gets enough exercise, mental stimulation, and affection. This will help them stay happy and relaxed, reducing stress-related hair loss.\n\n* **Tip:** Try interactive [toys](https://amzn.to/409Dt9G), training sessions, and playtime to keep your puppy mentally and physically stimulated.\n* USA Best [Dog Toys Check-in](https://amzn.to/409Dt9G)\n\n# 6. Regular Vet Checkups\n\nExcessive shedding can sometimes be a sign of underlying health problems, such as allergies, skin infections, or hormonal imbalances. If your Labrador puppy\u2019s shedding seems abnormal, it\u2019s a good idea to consult a vet. They can diagnose any health issues and suggest the best treatment.\n\n* **Tip:** Keep up with regular vet visits to ensure your puppy is in good health and not experiencing skin problems or allergies.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nManaging your Labrador puppy\u2019s hair fall is all about good grooming habits, a healthy diet, and regular care. By following these simple steps, you can help keep your puppy\u2019s coat shiny, healthy, and reduce excessive shedding.

That's what I'd prefer, since I'd like the additional safety and state tax advantages of investing only in Treasuries.\n\nBut wouldn't this affect your ability to withdraw funds from the account via check or debit card? Fidelity advertises that the CMA is technically a brokerage account - you could buy whatever securities you wanted in it if you didn't want to hold the whole balance as cash. But then you'd presumably not be able to just go to the ATM and get cash out from that amount - you could only do it from your core account position. \n\nIs this how it works?\n\n**Case A:** you leave the whole balance in the core position, either SPAXX or the FDIC-insured sweep.

Let's say you buy AMZN stock or the Fidelity Total Bond ETF or whatever with it. I assume that this case is straightforward, too: since the money is tied up in these securities, you need to manually sell them first for the cash to be withdrawable. (Fidelity's not going to liquidate $120 worth of AMZN automatically from your CMA every time you go to the ATM.)\n\n**Case C**: you put some or all of your CMA balance into a non-core-position money market fund like FDLXX. Despite the high liquidity of money market funds, this is still functionally equivalent to Case B, right? Since the money isn't in your core position, and all cash transactions are handled entirely through your core position, checks and whatnot won't be deducted from this amount automatically. Instead, you have to manually go in and sell FDLXX for cash before you can withdraw the cash. \n\nDo I have that right?

Cedercrans emphasizes that every human being is on the precipice of awakening to their Soul, a natural progression driven by the force of evolution. This book provides a series of teachings designed to help individuals recognize and connect with the Soul, encouraging the cultivation of higher awareness and spiritual understanding. Through the practice of meditation and introspection, readers are invited to explore the relationship between the Soul and its lower, material counterpart. Cedercrans offers a new \"Thought-Form Presentation of the Wisdom\" as a tool for spiritual seekers, allowing them to abstract divine knowledge through meditation and translate it into practical understanding for everyday life.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n\u2022 **The Evolutionary Shift to Soul Consciousness:** Cedercrans emphasizes that humanity is at a turning point, moving beyond mere self-consciousness toward the greater realization of Soul consciousness. This evolution is a natural and inevitable process, driven by the Soul\u2019s desire to express itself through the physical world. Humanity\u2019s dissatisfaction with materialism is a sign of this inner awakening, a call to seek higher spiritual values.\n\n\u2022 **The Soul\u2019s Presence in Mass Consciousness:** The book highlights that the Soul is actively influencing mass consciousness, pushing humanity toward spiritual awakening. Cedercrans notes that this influence is universal, affecting men and women everywhere, often manifesting as restlessness or discontent with material life. The collective search for peace and meaning is an expression of the Soul\u2019s movement within humanity.\n\n\u2022 **Meditation as a Path to Soul Recognition:** Central to Cedercrans' teachings is the practice of meditation, which she describes as the key method for contacting the Soul. Through meditation, individuals can access abstract spiritual wisdom and translate it into practical, concrete understanding. This practice fosters a deeper connection with the Soul and accelerates the process of awakening.\n\n\u2022 **The New Thought-Form Presentation of The Wisdom:** Cedercrans introduces a \"New Thought-Form Presentation of The Wisdom,\" a spiritual tool designed to help seekers access higher knowledge through meditation. This presentation represents a modern interpretation of ageless wisdom, providing practical guidance for individuals who are ready to engage with their Soul and the greater spiritual truths of the universe.\n\n\u2022 **The Role of the Soul in Personal and Collective Awakening:** The book outlines the Soul\u2019s role in guiding both individual and collective spiritual evolution.

The book bridges the gap between science and religion, offering an accessible explanation of complex topics such as quantum physics, relativity, neuroscience, and string theory, while drawing connections to spiritual experiences like miracles, immortality, and transcendent awareness. Selbie\u2019s central thesis is that the concepts traditionally labeled as \"spiritual\" or \"mystical\" are not only compatible with, but are deeply supported by modern scientific theories. Through clear metaphors and practical examples, Selbie seeks to dissolve the apparent conflict between science and religion, inviting readers to embrace a unified understanding of reality.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n\u2022 **Unity of Science and Spirituality:** Selbie argues that the perceived divide between science and spirituality is an illusion. By examining quantum physics, M-theory, and neuroscience, he reveals that many phenomena described by saints, mystics, and near-death experiences can be explained through the lens of modern science. This unity offers a profound shift in perspective, suggesting that science and religion are two sides of the same coin, both seeking to understand the same ultimate reality.\n\n\u2022 **Quantum Biology and Immortality:** One of the book\u2019s more intriguing concepts is how quantum biology provides a scientific explanation for immortality. Selbie explains that human consciousness and the body are entangled in ways that defy traditional biological understanding, suggesting that consciousness persists beyond physical death. This scientific framework mirrors religious teachings on the soul and the afterlife, providing a bridge between faith-based beliefs and empirical research.\n\n\u2022 **Transcendent Awareness and the Power of Mind:** Drawing on discoveries in neuroscience and relativity, Selbie emphasizes the mind\u2019s ability to create miracles and bring about instantaneous changes in the physical body. He connects this power to the teachings of spiritual leaders who have long claimed that thoughts and beliefs shape reality. This insight suggests that the human mind has far more control over the physical world than previously understood.\n\n\u2022 **Meditation as a Gateway to Transcendence:** The newly added chapter on the physics of meditation delves into how the practice aligns with the brain\u2019s natural frequencies and quantum states. Meditation, according to Selbie, enhances one's ability to access transcendent awareness by harmonizing with the energy fields described in quantum physics. This connection provides a scientific basis for the spiritual benefits long attributed to meditative practices.\n\n\u2022 **M-Theory and Multidimensional Reality:** The book also connects string theory\u2019s brane worlds\u2014the hidden dimensions of M-theory\u2014to the religious concept of transcendent heavens. Selbie argues that these dimensions are not only scientifically plausible but have been described by spiritual traditions for millennia. This suggests that the \"heavens\" described in religion may be multidimensional realms that science is only beginning to understand.\n\n\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders will walk away with a renewed perspective on the compatibility of science and spirituality. Selbie's explanations offer hope for those who feel torn between the rationality of science and the transcendence of religion, providing tools for personal transformation through meditation and conscious living. This book is ideal for anyone seeking to reconcile their spiritual beliefs with scientific understanding and for those curious about how the deepest truths of the universe intersect with our daily lives.\n\n\ud83d\udc8c **Your Experiences and Reflections:**\n\nHave you ever encountered a spiritual experience that felt deeply connected to scientific principles? How do you think the exploration of quantum physics or neuroscience might change your perspective on life, death, and consciousness?

Miller", "content": "\ud83c\udf3f **Detailed Overview:**\n\nA profound exploration of spirituality and how it can be integrated into everyday experiences. Drawing on various spiritual traditions, psychological insights, and mythological frameworks, Miller encourages readers to find the extraordinary within the ordinary aspects of their daily lives. The book delves into the wisdom of the Western spiritual tradition, shamanic practices, transpersonal psychology, and feminine spirituality, among others, to create a comprehensive guide for personal and spiritual growth. With an emphasis on holistic understanding, Miller offers a path to renewal that is both practical and deeply transformative.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n\u2022 **Spirituality in the Mundane:** Miller emphasizes that spirituality is not something separate from daily life but is found in the ordinary moments that make up our existence. This theme invites readers to look for moments of connection, meaning, and transcendence in the simplest activities\u2014whether it\u2019s in conversations, nature, or even routine tasks\u2014showing that the divine is always present.\n\n\u2022 **Western Spiritual Tradition and Transpersonal Psychology:** The book explores the integration of Western spiritual traditions with modern psychological insights, particularly transpersonal psychology, which bridges psychology and spirituality. Miller highlights how Western spirituality, traditionally rooted in religious practices, can evolve to meet the needs of the contemporary seeker, using psychology as a tool for deep self-exploration and spiritual transformation.\n\n\u2022 **Shamanism and Mythology as Tools for Renewal:** Drawing on the ancient practices of shamanism and mythological narratives, Miller provides a framework for readers to reconnect with primal sources of wisdom. He shows how shamanic practices can facilitate healing and spiritual renewal by tapping into the unseen realms, and how mythology provides symbolic maps for navigating life\u2019s challenges and transitions.\n\n\u2022 **Feminine Spirituality and Holistic Balance:** Miller acknowledges the resurgence of feminine spirituality and its role in balancing the often patriarchal tendencies in traditional religious frameworks. He explores how integrating the feminine\u2014through values like intuition, compassion, and nurturing\u2014can offer a more holistic approach to spiritual growth, contributing to a renewal of both personal and collective consciousness.\n\n\u2022 **Paths to Personal Transformation:** The overarching message of the book is that personal transformation is available to everyone, not just through isolated spiritual practices but by engaging fully in life. Miller offers practical advice on how to cultivate mindfulness, develop self-awareness, and create meaningful spiritual practices that align with the flow of daily life, helping readers renew themselves spiritually and emotionally.\n\n\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders will discover how spirituality can be woven into the fabric of their daily lives, offering a path to renewal and deeper meaning. Through exploring diverse traditions such as shamanism, mythology, and psychology, they will find accessible tools to transform their everyday experiences into moments of spiritual insight. The book serves as a reminder that personal growth and spiritual transformation do not require grand gestures but are found in living with intention and awareness.\n\n\ud83d\udc8c **Your Experiences and Reflections:**\n\nHow do you incorporate spirituality into your daily routine? Have you noticed moments of transcendence in ordinary life?

This book provides a candid, no-frills guide to navigating the complexities and challenges that arise after the initial experience of enlightenment, shedding light on the nuances of what comes next. Adyashanti speaks directly to those who have had spiritual breakthroughs and are seeking direction, emphasizing the common fluctuations between temporary awakening and the more permanent state of abiding enlightenment. This work serves as a practical and spiritual roadmap for living fully in the awakened state.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n\u2022 **The Transition from Awakening to Abiding Enlightenment:** Adyashanti introduces the distinction between \"nonabiding\" and \"abiding\" enlightenment, explaining that many people experience awakening in fleeting moments, only to feel that it slips away. He calls this the \"I got it/I lost it\" cycle, which can lead to confusion and frustration. This theme underscores the deeper work required to transition from temporary spiritual experiences to a stable, lived experience of enlightenment.\n\n\u2022 **Pitfalls and Traps of the Ego Post-Awakening:** After awakening, the ego can subtly reassert itself, creating a range of obstacles on the path to full realization. Adyashanti warns about common traps such as the illusion of spiritual superiority, where individuals might feel \"better\" or more enlightened than others, and the tendency for the ego to use spiritual insights for its own gain. This theme emphasizes the importance of staying vigilant and continuously questioning one\u2019s motives and perceptions.\n\n\u2022 **The Danger of Becoming \u201cDrunk on Emptiness\u201d:** One of the more profound insights Adyashanti discusses is the tendency for individuals to become overly attached to the experience of emptiness or nothingness that can accompany spiritual awakening. He calls this being \"drunk on emptiness\" and warns that it can lead to detachment from life and emotional isolation. This theme is crucial as it highlights the necessity of integrating spiritual insight with real-world engagement, rather than withdrawing into a state of separation.\n\n\u2022 **The Trap of Meaninglessness and Embracing Life Fully:** Many who awaken may experience a sense of meaninglessness, as their old frameworks of understanding are dissolved. Adyashanti guides readers through this existential dilemma, helping them see beyond the illusion of meaninglessness and embrace life with renewed vigor. This theme encourages readers to find joy and meaning in the present moment, beyond conceptual beliefs.\n\n\u2022 **Radical Honesty and Continuous Self-Inquiry:** A central tenet of Adyashanti\u2019s teachings is the need for sincere self-inquiry and radical honesty. Full awakening, he asserts, comes from questioning everything\u2014every belief, every identity, and even the nature of the self itself. This theme highlights that enlightenment is not a one-time event but an ongoing process of deepening understanding and dismantling of the egoic structures that obscure reality.\n\n\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders will gain invaluable insights into the often-unspoken challenges that arise after spiritual awakening. Adyashanti\u2019s guidance offers both comfort and challenge, urging those on the path to confront the subtle ways in which the ego can re-emerge and co-opt enlightenment. By embracing radical honesty, continuous self-inquiry, and a deep engagement with life, readers will be better equipped to transition from fleeting moments of awakening to the full, abiding state of enlightenment.\n\n\ud83d\udc8c **Your Experiences and Reflections:**\n\nHave you experienced moments of spiritual awakening that seemed to slip away?

The book is not centered around spiritual enhancement or achieving self-improvement, but rather about moving beyond the illusion of the ego to an awakened state of being. Adyashanti provides readers with foundational ideas, orienting concepts, and core practices designed to strip away the constructs of the egoic mind and bring about liberation. His teachings reflect the urgency and efficiency required for spiritual awakening, offering a guide that is both deeply transformative and accessible for spiritual seekers.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n\u2022 **Foundations of Spiritual Awakening:** Adyashanti outlines the core tenets that form the bedrock of spiritual awakening, urging readers to question their beliefs, release attachments, and realize the truth beyond egoic identity. He emphasizes that the journey to enlightenment begins by recognizing the limitations of the self and the illusions created by the ego. This foundational theme is meant to help seekers strip away the false layers of identity, leading them toward a state of pure consciousness.\n\n\u2022 **Orienting Ideas for Spiritual Practice:** The book introduces key ideas that help guide seekers on their spiritual path, focusing on concepts such as truth, liberation, and surrender. Adyashanti encourages readers to let go of preconceived notions and mental constructs that bind them to suffering and separation. By aligning their orientation with these deeper truths, individuals are able to shift their focus from ego-driven desires to the pursuit of genuine freedom.\n\n\u2022 **Core Practices for Liberation:** Adyashanti provides practical exercises and meditative practices that are aimed at facilitating direct experience of Reality. These practices focus on letting go of control, embracing stillness, and deeply observing the nature of consciousness. The core practices serve as powerful tools for individuals to confront their own mental and emotional obstacles, ultimately leading to the dissolution of the ego and the realization of their true, boundless nature.\n\n\u2022 **Beyond Ego to Awakened Being:** Central to Adyashanti\u2019s teachings is the process of moving from the dream-like state of egoic consciousness to the awakened state, where one experiences the flow of existence free from the constraints of self-identity. He emphasizes that awakening is not about achieving an enhanced state of being, but rather the realization of what already is\u2014the infinite and sacred nature of Reality. This theme highlights the immediacy of awakening and the necessity of leaving behind all attachments to the self.\n\n\u2022 **Living Enlightenment in Daily Life:** The final aspect of Adyashanti\u2019s teachings addresses the importance of embodying spiritual awakening in daily life. He underscores that liberation is not just a mystical experience but must be fully lived in every aspect of existence. By integrating awakened awareness into everyday actions and interactions, individuals can experience a profound sense of peace, authenticity, and freedom in their relationships, work, and personal life.\n\n\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders will be equipped with the essential ideas and practices needed to embark on the journey to spiritual enlightenment. This book serves as a guide for seekers who are ready to confront their egoic limitations and experience the deeper reality that lies beyond the self. Through the practical application of the teachings, individuals can realize the true nature of existence and bring that awareness into their daily lives, transforming their experience of reality and leading them toward authentic freedom.\n\n\ud83d\udc8c **Your Experiences and Reflections:**\n\nHave you explored spiritual practices aimed at moving beyond the egoic mind?

Tharp", "content": "In the world of trading and investing, it is often believed that success hinges on mastering the markets, following the right strategies, and making smart financial decisions. However, Van K. Tharp\u2019s *Trading Beyond the Matrix: The Red Pill for Traders and Investors* offers a radical shift in perspective, suggesting that the most important factor in achieving financial success is self-transformation. This book transcends the typical analysis of market dynamics and instead delves deep into personal psychology, neuroscience, and the power of beliefs in shaping our financial outcomes.\n\n# The Core Premise: Transformation Through \u201cTharp Think\u201d\n\nAt its core, *Trading Beyond the Matrix* is about changing one\u2019s mindset to unlock wealth-building potential. Tharp presents what he calls \"Tharp Think,\" a series of principles derived from studying top traders' behavior and beliefs. These principles go beyond traditional trading strategies, highlighting that it is not just about what traders know, but how they think and act. According to Tharp, the majority of traders fail because they are trapped by limiting beliefs\u2014what he calls \u201cthe Matrix\u201d\u2014that cloud their decision-making and prevent them from seeing the market as it truly is.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the film *The Matrix*, Tharp explains that people are often programmed with destructive beliefs imposed by society, which leads to self-sabotage. These beliefs, deeply rooted in fear, greed, and unconscious biases, create a mental \u201cMatrix\u201d that distorts reality and hinders financial progress. By taking the metaphorical \u201cred pill\u201d and stepping out of this mental trap, individuals can achieve the clarity necessary for success. This, in essence, is the foundation of his neuroscience-based wealth strategy.\n\n[How to transform your trading results by transforming yourself](https://preview.redd.it/vt04rbz8ervd1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=64cd11c1b4293b02349b1f72f4ccc4dc3f10e857)\n\nCheck: [Trading Beyond the Matrix: The Red Pill for Traders and Investors](https://amzn.to/3Yy9qGv)\n\n# Neuroscience and the Psychology of Wealth\n\nTharp's approach aligns with modern understandings of neuroscience, particularly in how the brain processes fear and reward. The human brain is wired to avoid risk and seek comfort, but in the high-stakes world of trading, these instincts can lead to poor decisions. Neuroscience teaches that much of our behavior is driven by subconscious processes that can be reprogrammed through focused self-awareness and deliberate practice.\n\n*Trading Beyond the Matrix* emphasizes that wealth creation is largely a mental game. Tharp provides tools for traders to \"reprogram\" their minds, moving away from reactive patterns driven by fear and greed. This approach is not only effective in trading but also in any endeavor where the stakes are high, and emotional control is critical. By aligning one\u2019s beliefs with a mindset of abundance and acceptance, traders can tap into their higher cognitive functions\u2014what Tharp describes as trading from a state of joy and acceptance, rather than from fear and desperation.\n\n# The Neuroscience of Belief Systems: Reprogramming for Success\n\nOne of the central elements of the book is the exploration of belief systems and how they govern behavior. Tharp argues that successful traders are distinguished not by their technical knowledge of the markets, but by their ability to adopt empowering beliefs and discard those that no longer serve them. He likens this process to a form of self-transformation that can be achieved through various techniques, including mindfulness, affirmations, and neuro-linguistic programming (NLP).\n\nNeuroscience supports the idea that beliefs are not fixed and can be changed with deliberate effort. By repeatedly engaging in behaviors and thought patterns that align with success, individuals can create new neural pathways that support more productive and empowering financial behaviors. This concept of neuroplasticity\u2014the brain\u2019s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections\u2014is a key component of Tharp\u2019s strategy. The idea is that traders can \"rewire\" their brains for success by adopting the mindset of top traders and practicing it until it becomes second nature.\n\n# Transforming Wealth Strategy Through Consciousness\n\nTharp's wealth strategy is rooted in the idea that consciousness and self-awareness are critical to financial success. In one of the book\u2019s key sections, he explains that many traders operate on a low level of consciousness, driven by reactive emotions like fear and greed. These emotional states activate the brain\u2019s survival mechanisms, which can lead to impulsive and irrational decisions\u2014exactly the kind of behavior that causes losses in the stock market.\n\nThe goal, according to Tharp, is to elevate one\u2019s consciousness to higher levels where acceptance and joy replace fear and greed. At these levels, traders are able to remain calm and make more rational decisions, even in the face of market volatility. This ties into the concept of emotional regulation in neuroscience, where maintaining a balanced emotional state allows for better cognitive performance, particularly in high-pressure environments.\n\n# Practical Application: Real Transformations\n\nThe most powerful aspect of *Trading Beyond the Matrix* lies in the real-life stories of transformation that Tharp shares throughout the book. Each chapter focuses on a different individual who applied Tharp\u2019s methods and experienced significant personal and financial breakthroughs. These stories serve as case studies, illustrating how the combination of self-awareness, belief transformation, and emotional regulation can lead to remarkable success.\n\nIn one example, a trader who had been struggling for years managed to completely turn his performance around by adopting Tharp Think and working on his limiting beliefs. The transformation wasn\u2019t just in his financial success, but in his overall well-being and mindset. This practical application of neuroscience principles shows that success in the market is not just about mastering strategies, but mastering oneself.\n\n*Trading Beyond the Matrix* offers more than just trading advice\u2014it provides a blueprint for personal transformation that leads to financial success. By tapping into the latest insights from neuroscience and psychology, Tharp teaches traders to reprogram their minds, elevating their consciousness and eliminating the limiting beliefs that keep them trapped in the Matrix. His wealth strategy is about mastering the inner game, which, once conquered, can lead to extraordinary results in the outer world of trading and beyond.\n\nFor those looking to improve not only their financial outcomes but also their overall mindset, this book is a powerful resource. It teaches that wealth begins within, and by transforming one\u2019s mind, it is possible to achieve lasting success.\n\nRelated: [When is the subconscious mind most active?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Askfreedom_Jinn/comments/1g7ccvz/when_is_the_subconscious_mind_most_active/)\n\n**Related Important Suggestions:** \n\n>`Like the left-hand image shows, the center of our brains is \u201coverheating\u201d...`  \n  \n`Which comes from our bad luck and limiting beliefs.`  \n  \n`It\u2019s the root wave of stress\u2026`\n\n>`And if this wave gets too \u201chot\u201d it can lead to dementia, strokes, even sudden heart problems\u2026`  \n  \n`All it takes to quiet down this signal of stress is 9-Word Script\u2026`  \n  \n`And they\u2019re revealing these findings in a brand new video:` [`https://freedom-man-wind.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-wealth-signal.html`](https://freedom-man-wind.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-wealth-signal.html)  `- The number of people who have seen concrete proof of real miracles is remarkable.`"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "AMZN", "page_content": {"title": "Best Backpacks For Meetings And Travel 2025\n", "content": "When it comes to travel, finding the right backpack can make all the difference.

Whether you're seeking immersive surround sound for movie nights, clear dialogue for TV shows, or rich bass for music, the options are vast and varied. Among the top contenders are the Sonos Arc, Bose Soundbar 700, Samsung HW-Q990C, LG S95QR, Vizio V Series, and JBL Bar 1300X. Each of these soundbars offers unique features and sound profiles, catering to different preferences and budgets, making it essential to find the one that best suits your needs.\n\n# 1.\u00a0[Sonos Arc](https://amzn.to/3zYR8FX)\n\nThe Sonos Arc is widely regarded as one of the best soundbars on the market, particularly for its immersive sound quality and sleek design. It supports Dolby Atmos, which enhances the spatial audio experience, making it ideal for movies and music alike. The soundstage is expansive, with clear dialogue and rich bass. The integration with the Sonos ecosystem also allows for easy multi-room audio setup. However, it lacks a dedicated subwoofer, which some users might miss for deep bass.\n\n# 2.\u00a0[Bose Soundbar 700](https://amzn.to/3BOqQ9Z)\n\nThe Bose Soundbar 700 is known for its premium build quality and sophisticated design. It delivers a well-balanced sound profile with clear dialogue and punchy bass. The ADAPTiQ audio calibration technology optimizes sound for your room's acoustics, enhancing the listening experience. It's also compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant, making it a smart addition to your home. However, it doesn't support Dolby Atmos, which might be a downside for those looking for the latest surround sound technology.\n\n# 3.\u00a0[Samsung HW-Q990C](https://amzn.to/401TXRj)\n\nThe Samsung HW-Q990C is a powerhouse when it comes to sound performance. It features an 11.1.4 channel setup, including up-firing and side-firing speakers that create a truly immersive audio experience. With Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support, it delivers top-tier surround sound, especially when paired with a compatible Samsung TV. The bass is deep and impactful, thanks to the included subwoofer. The soundbar is also compatible with Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology, which synchronizes the soundbar with the TV\u2019s speakers for a more expansive sound. It's a bit pricey but offers excellent value for those who prioritize sound quality.\n\n# 4.\u00a0[LG S95QR](https://amzn.to/4eHC1zH)\n\nThe LG S95QR is a feature-rich soundbar that excels in delivering cinematic audio experiences. It supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X and includes up-firing speakers that enhance the sense of height in the soundstage. The soundbar comes with a wireless subwoofer and rear speakers, creating a 9.1.5 channel setup. The dialogue clarity is impressive, and the overall sound is powerful and immersive. It's also compatible with Google Assistant and Alexa, adding to its versatility. The only downside is that the setup can be a bit complex, especially with multiple components.\n\n# 5.\u00a0[Vizio V Series](https://amzn.to/4eAOXaF)\n\nThe Vizio V Series soundbars are known for offering solid performance at an affordable price. They provide good sound quality for casual listening, with decent bass and clear dialogue. While they don\u2019t support Dolby Atmos, they still deliver a respectable surround sound experience with DTS Virtual:X. The V Series is a great entry-level option for those who want to upgrade their TV\u2019s audio without breaking the bank. However, the build quality and features are more basic compared to higher-end models.\n\n# 6.\u00a0[JBL Bar 1300X](https://amzn.to/3BLjkN6)\n\nThe JBL Bar 1300X is a versatile soundbar that offers a robust sound profile with plenty of power. It includes detachable wireless surround speakers, which can be placed anywhere in the room for a more flexible setup. The soundbar supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, providing a rich and immersive audio experience. The bass is particularly strong, thanks to the included wireless subwoofer. Additionally, it has built-in voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant. However, the soundbar can be a bit bulky, and the detachable speakers may require frequent recharging.\n\nEach of these soundbars has its strengths, so your choice should depend on your specific needs, whether it's premium sound quality, immersive surround sound, smart features, or affordability."}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "AMZN", "page_content": {"title": "Best noise cancelling earbuds right now", "content": "When it comes to noise-canceling earbuds, having the right pair can make all the difference, whether you\u2019re commuting, working, or just trying to enjoy your music without distractions.

", "content": "I\u2019m 21M and it doesn\u2019t seem like I can do college right now. I\u2019m pretty sure I just bombed my calculus midterm this past Friday, after bombing the first two. You can only replace 2 out of the 4, which means one from each half of the course. I\u2019m a Junior in college and my gpa is 2.93 and I thought I was working towards getting my gpa back to 3.0 and my scholarship back ( scholarship gpa is 2.7 and I need a 3.0 ) but now I think I destroyed my chances. \n\nIt\u2019s always this same cycle of not studying or taking notes and then cramming at the last minute. It makes me think I want to fail. Even though, my parents continued to pay for school after I lost my scholarship. I lost at the end of freshman year and they paid for the summer after freshman year and the entire sophomore year. They\u2019re also paying for this first semester of junior year. I wish I could pay them the money back. I even said I could drop out and commit to working full time so I could pay them the money back. I just don\u2019t think college is for me. It\u2019s funny because at registration I sign up for classes and tell myself I\u2019m going to do well this time. But then I repeat the same bullshit pattern of just showing up to class and not putting forth any effort to learn. I do go office hours and complete homework but that\u2019s about it. And if it\u2019s not something I can Google or use a calculator I usually do 75% to half because I end up not understanding how to do something and it\u2019s too late to go to office hours. I\u2019m always procrastinating. \n\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like I\u2019m blowing off school to party or do drugs ( nothing wrong with that, just making a point ). I pretty much do nothing all day. I spend 5-10 hours on social media: mostly reading stuff on Reddit or X. I usually read hours of threads going thru the comments. I don\u2019t exercise or hang out with friends because I don\u2019t really have any. Not blaming anyone but myself for that, just being upfront. I watch TV occasionally as I finished Bleach and I\u2019m caught to TYBW and I\u2019m always caught up on the One Piece manga save for Elbaf and Egghead for the anime. But I usually don\u2019t watch TV. I basically wake up, go to class, come home, do homework if I have any, but no studying or anything. I\u2019m just passively refusing to do anything to better myself in the future. I read up on something called hyperbolic discounting and it describes me pretty well. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m an economics major and I can\u2019t say I enjoy it nor do I hate it. Slowly I\u2019ve really started to appreciate economics as a framework for modeling human behavior and identifying what motivated us albeit on specific circumstances that aren\u2019t always applicable. This semester I have a class called Money & Capital Markets and the professor is old school, lecturing by mainly talking to us and writing equations and graphs on the board. I actually really enjoy going to office hours and look forward to it.We talk about economics but I also like to ask questions about his life: what brought him to economics, why he chose to teach at my school. He\u2019s very open imo so he\u2019ll go on tangents and we\u2019ll get into other things. \n\n\nAdmittedly, perhaps this isn\u2019t appropriate. I don\u2019t really have a relationship with anyone outside of my immediate family. My dads side live in New York and my moms side lives in Ghana, West Africa. My aunt ( dad\u2019s sister) lives in GA but she was very spiteful towards my mom when she immigrated here after marrying my dad so she doesn\u2019t really visit often. My brothers and I go over to her house every so often. I\u2019m saying all this to say I think one reason why I enjoy speaking with this professor so much is that I\u2019ve never experienced having grandparents that I can talk to and receive wisdom from. I really appreciate it. I love my family dearly but they\u2019re very religious so I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing my thoughts on certain things. For similar reasons, I don\u2019t really open up with anyone at church. The professor is a deist so I feel more comfortable asking questions. His clsss is probably the class I\u2019ve done the best in terms of engaging with the material. I\u2019m not counting down the minutes and I\u2019m starting to really get into the subject matter. \n\n\nI think I just need help figuring how to stop self sabotaging. I think I could do well in school if I put honest effort but I\u2019m struggling to do that. It almost feel like I don\u2019t want to get better. I\u2019m not suicidal at all but I think I could be depressed. I feel like my heavy media consumption explains the ADD like symptoms. But I don\u2019t want to self diagnose or anything because I understand that waters down the seriousness of people who are actually depressed and actually ADHD. I don\u2019t even think I have good reason to be depressed. My parents take care of me and I know they love me. It just feels like I don\u2019t want to put effort into my own life, even though I benefit from it ultimately in the long run.

Skal vi holde det i Jylland, Fyn, Sj\u00e6lland\u2026 eller m\u00e5ske p\u00e5 en af de 1417 andre \u00f8er, vi har liggende? :tada:\n\nDerudover er sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5let: **Skal vi arrangere noget fancy**, eller vil I hellere bare m\u00f8des p\u00e5 en gr\u00e6smark, se hinanden an og f\u00f8le os lidt som \u201ck\u00e6ldermennesker\u201d? Vi er \u00e5bne for alle id\u00e9er, s\u00e5 fyr l\u00f8s i kommentarerne!\n\n## 4. **Live Q&A p\u00e5 Discord \u2013 Skal vi snakke lidt?**\nVi overvejer ogs\u00e5 at afholde en **live Q&A-session p\u00e5 Discord**, hvor I kan stille sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l til moderatorerne og h\u00f8re, hvad der egentlig foreg\u00e5r bag kulisserne. Men f\u00f8r vi fasts\u00e6tter en dato og tid, vil vi gerne h\u00f8re fra jer: **Er der overhovedet interesse?**\n\nVi har nogle id\u00e9er til emner, som vi kunne tage op, men vi vil gerne h\u00f8re, hvad I synes:\n- **Hvem er moderatorerne egentlig?** H\u00f8r de pinlige detaljer om, hvem vi er, og hvorfor vi g\u00f8r, hvad vi g\u00f8r.\n- **Regler \u2013 love it or hate it?** Vi gennemg\u00e5r reglerne og tager en snak om, hvad der fungerer (eller ikke g\u00f8r!).\n  - **Relevans i reglerne** \u2013 Hvordan s\u00f8rger vi for, at de afspejler, hvad f\u00e6llesskabet faktisk har brug for?\n  - **Tonen i debatten** \u2013 En hot topic! Foresl\u00e5et af broder. Hvordan kan vi sikre, at vi ikke fl\u00e5r hovederne af hinanden under diskussionerne?\n- **Ordet Frit** \u2013 Her er jeres chance for at sp\u00f8rge om ALT! Er du nysgerrig p\u00e5 moderationen, reglerne eller noget helt tredje? Det er tid til at f\u00e5 svar!\n\nS\u00e5 hvad siger I? Kom med jeres input i kommentarerne, og hvis I har id\u00e9er til andre emner, s\u00e5 t\u00f8v ikke med at dele dem!\n## 5. **Overskriftreglen \u2013 Skal vi snakke om det?**\nLad os tale om **Overskriftreglen**. Den har skabt lidt debat, s\u00e5 her er the deal: Den **forbyder ikke** brugen af originale overskrifter fra artikler. Men, og det er et stort men, **du skal l\u00e6se overskriften** og vurdere, om den overholder vores regler om at v\u00e6re **beskrivende, faktuel og neutral**. Hvis den ikke g\u00f8r det, skal du **skrive din egen overskrift**, der lever op til kravene. Sounds fair, right?\n\nMen nu vil vi gerne h\u00f8re fra jer: **Fungerer reglen, som den er, eller er det tid til en justering?** Har I oplevet, at det skaber forvirring? Del jeres tanker og eksempler i kommentarerne!\n\n## 6. **Opdateringer i regels\u00e6ttet \u2013 L\u00e6s dem, folkens!**\nVi har v\u00e6ret i gang med at finjustere vores regels\u00e6t, og **snart vil de nye regler v\u00e6re synlige i sidemenuen**. Det er altid en god id\u00e9 at opdatere sig p\u00e5 reglerne \u2013 ikke fordi det er sp\u00e6ndende l\u00e6sning, men fordi det g\u00f8r f\u00e6llesskabet sjovere for os alle. :wink:\n\nS\u00e5 tag et kig, n\u00e5r de er live, og v\u00e6r klar til at kommentere. Vi har ogs\u00e5 shufflet lidt rundt p\u00e5 wikien, s\u00e5 det er det perfekte tidspunkt til at opdatere dig p\u00e5 hele molevitten!\n\n## 7. **Nu strammer vi op p\u00e5 debattonen i debatter om Israel/Pal\u00e6stina**\n\nVi har ogs\u00e5 valgt at fjerne reglen L1 Israel/Pal\u00e6stina. Reglen var tilt\u00e6nkt som en midlertidig foranstaltning mod den meget hadske og eskalererende debat som emnet ofte afledte, hvilket gav et stort antal anmeldelser for personangreb, racisme og opfordring til vold - ogs\u00e5 blandt erfarne brugere der burde kende regels\u00e6ttet. \n\nVi havde ogs\u00e5 h\u00e5bet at reglen ville lette vores arbejde ved ikke at skulle behandle de afledte regelbrud, men da vi ikke indf\u00f8rte sanktionsmuligheder for reglen endte det blot med at de samme brugere fortsatte med at bryde reglen - og at vi brugte en masse tid p\u00e5 at fjerne indhold uden at brugerne rettede sig ind.\n\nVores overvejelser gik p\u00e5 om reglen skulle opgraderes p\u00e5 niveau med p\u00e5mindelser om Debattone, s\u00e5 det blev noteret i modnoter og hvor gentagne brud p\u00e5 reglen ville svare til en enkelt p\u00e5tale.\n\nVi har dog valgt at fjerne reglen og fokusere skarpere p\u00e5 de afledte regelbrud. Hold derfor gerne en god debattone n\u00e5r I debatterer emnet, og husk at undg\u00e5 personangreb, racisme og opfordring til vold da s\u00e5danne regelbrud vil blive sanktioneret.\n## 8. **Eksempler p\u00e5 brugerrapporter**\nHer er et udpluk af de brugerrapporter, vi modtager. Husk, rapporter er en vigtig del af at holde r/Denmark k\u00f8rende, men vi mods er ogs\u00e5 mennesker og g\u00f8r vores bedste for at f\u00f8lge med.\n\n1. *\"HESTENET\"*\n2. *\"Hvorfor fanden bruge lousy n\u00e5r ordet elendig eksisterer?\"*\n3. *\"Kan vi ha' et forbud mod ragebait-artikler?

Kan vi ikke snart f\u00e5 den linie i siger der er i jeres moderationer?*\n\n## 9. **Beskeder til mods \u2013 Husk, vi er ogs\u00e5 mennesker!**\nAt v\u00e6re moderator kan til tider v\u00e6re en udfordring. Vi vil gerne minde jer om, at vi ogs\u00e5 er mennesker, og tonen er vigtig. Her er nogle eksempler p\u00e5 beskeder, vi modtager som mods:\n\n**Eksempler p\u00e5 beskeder modteamet modtager (15 i alt):**\n\n1. *\"Jeg ved hvor du bor.\"*\n2. *\"Ja fuck dig anmelder dig.\"*\n3. *\"Chikanesvin.\"*\n4. *\"SkibDen, du er da bare den st\u00f8rste kujon...

N\u00e5r vi ikke har det gr\u00f8nne skjold ved vores brugernavn, deltager vi som almindelige brugere og kan ogs\u00e5 modtage p\u00e5taler ligesom jer. Vi har ret til vores personlige holdninger, n\u00e5r vi ikke har \"uniformen\" p\u00e5. Uanset om du skriver til en moderator eller en anden bruger, s\u00e5 husk, at der altid sidder et menneske p\u00e5 den anden side af sk\u00e6rmen. Vi opfordrer jer til at behandle hinanden med respekt og ordentlighed, s\u00e5 vi sammen kan skabe et bedre og sundere milj\u00f8 for alle p\u00e5 r/Denmark.\n\n## 10. **Farvel til \"Studietorsdag\" tematr\u00e5dene**\nVi har valgt at lukke de ugentlige **Studietorsdag**-tr\u00e5de, da de desv\u00e6rre ikke har v\u00e6ret brugt ret meget.

You could find anything about everything in at least one of the books in this library. However, in order to check out a book, you must talk to one librarian. You tell the librarian what topic you'd like to learn, and they will search the library's collection and return with a box of relevant books. Since all human knowledge contained in this library is guarded by the librarian, how do you know the librarian doesn't have malicious intent and is purposely excluding certain books from the box they give you?

Obviously, not *all* of human knowledge is contained on the internet, but a huge amount is. But we access this information through a search engine like Google or Bing.

This error typically occurs when trying to run code that works fine with **cURL**, but fails within a **Node.js** environment. Such problems can be frustrating, especially for those new to **Vertex AI**.\n\nThe error message, which includes references to a DOCTYPE and invalid JSON, is often an indication that the response from the API is not in the expected format. This happens when HTML content is returned instead of the expected JSON response, making it difficult to process. In such cases, troubleshooting becomes essential.\n\nWhile the error might point to issues within the code, such as improper request handling, it is crucial to also investigate potential setup problems, particularly when using **Google Cloud CLI** on a local machine, like Windows. Even though the Vertex AI documentation offers sample code, slight differences in environment setup can cause inconsistencies.\n\nThis article dives into the specifics of this error and explores common troubleshooting steps. We will examine code snippets, explore the potential causes, and offer practical solutions for developers facing the DOCTYPE error in Vertex AI's generateContent function.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h0zooxa2ixvd1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d9a890e4c66ce4441095af5edc7d470b9aadf32\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Breaking Down the Vertex AI Script and Error Handling\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvvgswfyhxvd1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=960b890f8436122c9a1ddfa45c4109792a74f068\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe scripts provided earlier are designed to handle the process of generating content using **Google Cloud Vertex AI** in a Node.js environment. The main purpose of the script is to query the Vertex AI generative models, like \"gemini-1.0-pro\", by sending a user input and receiving the AI's response. However, when handling APIs, unexpected issues such as receiving HTML content instead of JSON can occur. This is where the critical methods and error-handling techniques come into play. The script ensures that the response is properly parsed into JSON format, preventing the \"**DOCTYPE** error\" issue mentioned.\n\nThe first solution focuses on error handling using the **try...catch** block. This ensures that if an error is encountered while calling the **generateContent** function, the script does not crash. Instead, the error is caught, and a meaningful message is logged to the console. This kind of robust error handling is especially important when dealing with external services like Google Cloud Vertex AI, where network issues or incorrect API responses may result in failures. Furthermore, the use of asynchronous functions ensures that the API call is properly handled without blocking other operations, which is essential for optimizing performance.\n\nAnother key element in the script is the use of **result.json()**, which is crucial for parsing the API's response into a usable format. The problem in this case arises because the API response is not always guaranteed to be in JSON format. By checking the **Content-Type** header, the second solution ensures that the response is actually in JSON format before attempting to parse it. This helps prevent the script from trying to parse an HTML error page (like the one in the DOCTYPE error) as JSON, which would lead to the \"Unexpected token '<'\" error.\n\nIn the third solution, the focus shifts to testing. Here, **unit tests** are implemented using the Mocha and Chai libraries. Unit testing is a critical step in ensuring that the code behaves as expected across different environments and scenarios. By stubbing the API calls, the tests can simulate various responses from the Vertex AI service, allowing developers to verify that the code can handle both success and error cases properly. This approach ensures that the final product is more resilient and reliable, as it has been tested for a range of possible outcomes.\n\n### Resolving Vertex AI generateContent Error: Different Approaches in Node.js\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/loe5hs0zhxvd1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5addb3596c0163c0348571c9c51f33476a62d24f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing Node.js with Google Cloud Vertex AI SDK for content generation\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0z3x6s2ixvd1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=36ce5a91616c0f879deb3f97b39d5b85ef7ec007\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    // Solution 1: Handling Unexpected HTML Response with Correct Fetching\n    const { VertexAI } = require('@google-cloud/vertexai');\n    const vertexAI = new VertexAI({ project: 'your-project-id', location: 'your-location' });\n    const model = vertexAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-1.0-pro' });\n    async function run(command) {\n    try {\n    const result = await model.generateContent({ contents: [{ role: 'user', parts: command }] });\n    const jsonResponse = await result.json();\n       console.log(jsonResponse);\n    } catch (error) {\n       console.error('Error processing response:', error.message);\n    }\n    }\n    run(\"What is the capital of India?\");\n\n### Improving Error Handling and Adding Content-Type Validation\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xxdmmqlzhxvd1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4625ba634d335922fa7e93859c7ddfb794f2a19a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNode.js: Validating Response and Handling Non-JSON Responses\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ja4pf53ixvd1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=95b1b192108bac152fe10dc59d42e2d5a4035a14\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    // Solution 2: Checking Content-Type Header to Ensure JSON\n    const { VertexAI } = require('@google-cloud/vertexai');\n    const vertexAI = new VertexAI({ project: 'your-project-id', location: 'your-location' });\n    const model = vertexAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-1.0-pro' });\n    async function run(command) {\n    try {\n    const result = await model.generateContent({ contents: [{ role: 'user', parts: command }] });\n    if (result.headers.get('content-type').includes('application/json')) {\n    const jsonResponse = await result.json();\n         console.log(jsonResponse);\n    } else {\n         console.error('Unexpected response format:', result.headers.get('content-type'));\n    }\n    } catch (error) {\n       console.error('Error fetching content:', error.message);\n    }\n    }\n    run(\"What is the capital of India?\");\n\n### Adding Unit Tests to Validate JSON Parsing and Error Handling\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6k1onr60ixvd1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23722bea7f48487d059952841125546d1a5604af\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNode.js: Testing with Mocha and Chai for Valid JSON Responses\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5d3e8wi3ixvd1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f50000f65f7e121dbc0ebca528d0079197431f4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    // Solution 3: Writing Unit Tests for Vertex AI with Mocha and Chai\n    const chai = require('chai');\n    const { expect } = chai;\n    const sinon = require('sinon');\n    const { VertexAI } = require('@google-cloud/vertexai');\n    describe('Vertex AI Generate Content', () => {\n    it('should return valid JSON content', async () => {\n    const vertexAI = new VertexAI({ project: 'test-project', location: 'test-location' });\n    const model = vertexAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-1.0-pro' });\n    const stub = sinon.stub(model, 'generateContent').returns(Promise.resolve({\n    json: () => ({ response: 'New Delhi' }),\n    headers: { get: () => 'application/json' }\n    }));\n    const result = await model.generateContent('What is the capital of India?');\n    const jsonResponse = await result.json();\n    expect(jsonResponse.response).to.equal('New Delhi');\n       stub.restore();\n    });\n    });\n\n### Understanding Vertex AI Response Issues in Node.js\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qczpgtr0ixvd1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbba49cd423e08e7e344934d7c459c66923c327f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen working with **Google Cloud Vertex AI** in Node.js, a key aspect to consider is how data is exchanged between the API and the application. One common issue, as seen in this scenario, is receiving an unexpected HTML response instead of the expected JSON format. This can lead to syntax errors, such as \"Unexpected token DOCTYPE,\" which occur because the code tries to parse HTML as if it were JSON. The root cause is usually a misconfigured request, an incorrect API endpoint, or a problem with authentication.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s important to remember that **Node.js** operates differently than command-line tools like **cURL**. While cURL directly interacts with the API over HTTP, Node.js makes use of packages like the Google Cloud SDK. These libraries add layers of abstraction, meaning extra error handling and validation are necessary to ensure proper data exchange. Setting up headers correctly, especially the \"Content-Type\" for both requests and responses, is critical for handling API calls smoothly.\n\nAnother factor that could lead to errors is network configuration or local environment settings. When running the Vertex AI SDK on a local machine, the CLI environment might behave differently than a cloud-based environment. Issues like local proxy settings, firewall configurations, or missing environment variables may affect the response from Vertex AI. Thus, developers should ensure that their local environment mimics the cloud environment as closely as possible to avoid inconsistencies when switching between them.\n\n#### Common Questions About Vertex AI DOCTYPE Errors in Node.js\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcw8ysc1ixvd1.jpg?width=1155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f4a19b4580e6e016296800cda59b58cefdf2afb\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat causes the \"DOCTYPE\" error in Vertex AI responses?\n\nThe \"DOCTYPE\" error occurs when the API returns an HTML response instead of the expected JSON format. This often happens due to incorrect API calls, improper endpoints, or authentication issues.\n\nHow can I avoid HTML responses in Node.js when using Vertex AI?\n\nEnsure that you are making API requests to the correct endpoint, and always validate the response headers. Use **result.headers.get('content-type')** to check if the response is JSON before parsing it.\n\nWhy does my cURL command work but not my Node.js script?\n\ncURL interacts directly with the API using HTTP, while Node.js uses additional libraries, such as the Google Cloud SDK. Ensure the SDK is correctly configured and handling authentication and request formatting properly.\n\nHow can I handle unexpected responses in my Node.js application?\n\nUse **try...catch** blocks in asynchronous functions to catch errors and implement checks for the **Content-Type** header to avoid parsing errors from unexpected HTML responses.\n\nHow can I test my Vertex AI Node.js code locally?\n\nYou can simulate API responses using libraries like **sinon.stub** to create test cases and use **Mocha** and **Chai** to write unit tests. This ensures your code behaves as expected in different environments.\n\n#### Final Thoughts on Troubleshooting Vertex AI Errors\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o55yrux1ixvd1.jpg?width=1155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e2d05aee3b450c6efac71d608d1f9db29910a4d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDealing with \"Unexpected token DOCTYPE\" errors in Vertex AI usually indicates a response format issue. Checking the API configuration and ensuring the correct content type is returned can help prevent such issues. Proper error handling is key to solving this problem.\n\nBy addressing these issues, developers can avoid JSON parsing errors and ensure smooth interaction with Google Cloud's AI services. Using appropriate validation, testing, and troubleshooting techniques guarantees robust and reliable application performance.\n\n###### Sources and References for Vertex AI Error Resolution\n\nInformation on the Vertex AI SDK and its documentation can be found on the official Google Cloud documentation page.

They are musicians and have a pretty decent following in the country/folk scene and do well on youtube with one video having almost 10M views. However, with that said, they are pretty \"homemade\" and thus far have used a local recording studio, and the same guy records, mixes and masters their tracks.\n\nTheir first album turned out great, the second one was ok, but they have just recorded a 3rd, and it just doesn't sound right. The instruments are all well done by professional musicians, and the mix on them seems fine if not fantastic, but their voices in the mix just aren't right.\n\nThe studio guy who did everything is quite touchy and takes offence if they aren't happy with the final product or want changes. However they've invested a lot in the recording process, and in order to build on their following etc., this album needs to be professional quality.\n\nSo with all that said, I have some questions on their behalf:\n\n1. How does one know if what a track/tracks need is to be mixed, mastered, or both?\n\n2. What is the best way to find the right person for the job? I'm sure there are literally thousands of people, from amateur to top-tier out there, so it is a slightly daunting task to pick someone.\n\n3. I have done some Googling in terms of Mastering and the price for a professional seems to range from $70-200 per track. However how much could one expect to pay for mixing plus mastering?\n\nI know this post will read quite noob-ish, but they never expected things to go as well as they have, and are very slightly out of their depth with all these things, and not wanting to lose momentum on their careers due to poor recording quality.\n\nAll advice appreciated! \n\nThanks."}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "GOOGL", "page_content": {"title": "\u2026 Kronk!

These actions, coupled with Musk's promotion of right-wing ideologies and misinformation on Twitter, have contributed to a more polarized online environment and raised concerns about the undue influence of wealthy individuals on political narratives. \n* **Peter Thiel's backing of JD Vance:** Thiel, a prominent venture capitalist, has heavily funded Vance's political career, despite Vance's anti-LGBTQ+ stance, contrasting with Thiel's own sexual orientation. This example highlights how billionaires can use their wealth to elevate politicians who align with their interests, regardless of the politician's stance on issues that might directly affect the billionaire. \n* **Cryptocurrency platforms and fake support for Trump:** Some sources allege that cryptocurrency platforms, particularly one backed by Peter Thiel, have been exploited to create a false impression of strong public support for Trump. Commenters suggest that this manipulation is intended to influence public perception and potentially sway elections.\n* **Texas courts and corporate bias:** Sources suggest that Musk's choice of Texas courts for legal proceedings related to Twitter highlights a perceived conservative bias within the Texan legal system, favorable to corporations and conservative ideologies. This situation, seen as a strategic maneuver by Musk, points to how billionaires can exploit legal systems for their advantage.\n\n**Manipulation of the Left:**\n\n* **Limited information about left-wing manipulation:** While the sources extensively detail billionaire influence on the right, they provide limited information about similar manipulation on the left. \n* **George Soros as a counter-example:** Some commenters point to George Soros as a potential counter-example of a billionaire influencing the left. However, this comparison is deemed inadequate by other users, and the sources lack specific details on how Soros might be manipulating the left.\n* **Potential for manipulation through media and technology:**  The sources illustrate how billionaires can exert influence through media ownership and control over technology platforms. These avenues of manipulation, while predominantly used by right-leaning billionaires in the examples provided, could theoretically be used to manipulate individuals on the left as well.\n\nIt's important to note that the sources are primarily Reddit discussions, potentially representing a limited viewpoint.  More comprehensive research from diverse sources is necessary to understand the full extent of billionaires' manipulation on both sides of the political spectrum in America. \n\n\nDamn \ud83d\udc40 (27:56)\n\nhttps://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/ebe54b72-cc9b-4d73-a241-76921b4f5331/audio"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "GOOGL", "page_content": {"title": "Anxiety suddenly took control of my life, can you give me any advice? GAD. Adult ADHDer", "content": "Hello guys. I need some tips, because I feel kinda hopeless and lost.\n\nI am 30yo man. I had very successful and nice life, kinda messy, but kinda stable, until I got diagnosed with ADHD. It happened to me in a very painful way. I contacted CBT therapist about 9 months ago, I came with only 2 problems: sleeping issues (going sleep very late, like 4-5am, sometimes even in the morning, like 8-9am) and problems with maintaining meaningful relations, which also led to many impulsive sexual behaviors, which I also wanted to stop. I was very successful work wise, I had many friends, some self confidence issues but I masked it well with all my work successes. My therapist suggested that I might have ADHD, but at this moment I was like: yeah, whetever, I might have it, I might not have it, what does it change? I feel well and I don't feel I need to be medicated, so why would we even bother? But she told me that we NEED TO diagnose it before we start CBT program.\n\nI left my country to work online in South East Asia. I was there for a month with my friend and then he left. I was there completely alone, for the first time in my life I had no one around me. I thought it's gonna be a nice experience, because I traveled a lot for like last 10 years with other ppl. And since I had so much time, I decided to resume my therapy. We started to diagnose ADHD, it came out it's \"probably positive\". In the meantime my grandma went to the hospital and I had a little emotional crisis. I cried for the first time in probably 10+ years, but after few hours I was completely fine, I shut off my emotions like I always did. After a week I had my first anxiety/panic attack, but I just thought it was because of the coffee I drunk on the empty stomach. Week later I had anxiety/panic attack again, it also happened with coffee on empty stomach, also it happened after eating in the same restaurant. I told my therapist about attacks and she was like: yeah yeah it looks like a panic attack, don't be afraid, they always pass and you will be fine. She kinda said it like it was completely normal thing for an adult person.\n\nWhen we finished ADHD diagnose. She was like: \"oh we have to check one more thing\", but she didn't want to tell me what. We made tests. By the questions I got, I was sure we are diagnosing depression. We finished the diagnose and she was like: \"it came negative! Do you know what did we check? BPD! But it's all fine, you don't need to worry, it's negative. I had to check it because BPD and ADHD are very similar, so I had to make sure\". And when I heard that ADHD and BPD are similar I just got crazy about wtf is ADHD then. I focused on all the negative sides of ADHD, I started to find all these attributes in myself. Just imagine, I am completely alone 15k km from my home, I just had the worst time of my life, first panic attacks, my grandma is in hospital, I am thinking only about how bad grandson I am because I didn't visit her in a long time. And then the only person I am talking to regularly secretly made BPD tests on me.\n\nThat was the moment when my life turned upside down. The last month I stayed in Asia was the worst time of my life. My body was extremely tense because of the anxiety. I was completely alone there, just me and my computer connected to the internet. All I did was googling what is ADHD, what is wrong with this. I started to realized how weird I am. I always thought I am different but in like a good way, I liked to be different and my whole life was a proof that I am right and everyone else is wrong. Everything I liked about myself just got ruined in one moment. The anxiety was so huge that I couldn't sleep. I had small derealization episodes. I was even afraid to go back home, even tho I made like 50+ flights in my life.\n\nWhen I came back to my hometown, I started to visit my therapists again. All she was saying was: Don't worry, it's gonna be better, it's normal to feel worse when starting therapy bla bla bla. I continued therapy for another 6 months. Last month, she came back from 1 month vacation. After resuming therapy my anxiety got so bad that I had to take take Xanax, after 2 weeks of taking Xanax I got prescribed mirtazapine.\n\nMy life is one huge mess right now, I have huge General Anxiety Disorder and I have no idea how to cope with it. I don't think I ever had anxiety attacks before that trip, and now I am waking up and I \"feel weird\" 24/7. I feel like my body is so tense. I can't focus on anything, 95% of my thoughts are negative. I tried mindfullness and relaxation techniques, but it's almost impossible to me for stay still for a longer period. I wasn't like that. I had small \"depression\" episodes before, but I wouldn't even call it a real depression. But now I just don't know who I am anymore, who should I be, I am afraid to travel again, I am even afraid to go out from my home very often. I am afraid about my physical health, my mental health, my family. I felt like I had everything under my control before that trip and now I lost it all. That's such a weird feeling. I am also thinking about these derealzation episodes a lot and I always look around and ask myself \"is it happening to me again?\". I finally decided to leave my CBT therapist and went to psychodynamic guy. I am also afraid about opening to him as well. I just feel lost and hopeless.

This isn't a prowlarr problem. \n\n  \n...you can see that sometimes (rarely) it \\_does\\_ work, so, for instance, for Sonarr, when it works it might download a bundle of 5-8 TV shows via my download client. \n\nGoing manually to the indexer (say, api.nzbplanet.net) works fine.  DNS queries (nslookup api.nzbplanet.net) works great.  A quick google suggests this is a bug in these apps, perhaps in the mono framework, but I don't see anything else.  Does anyone have any suggestions? \n\n"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "GOOGL", "page_content": {"title": "Dick Bomb", "content": "This story occurred while I was a Special Forces candidate. I was in holdover, waiting to begin the Q-course after selection, when I decided that I was going to get jacked. So I asked a guy named Ken, who I\u2019d gone to basic training with, about roids. He\u2019d always denied juicing, claimed to be natty, but I knew that there was no way this guy was able to recover from three workouts a day plus smoke sessions and PT and still be huge. Sure enough, over some beers, he admitted to \u201clightly using\u201d; I pressed him for more details and asked for a point of contact. He obliged. He gave me the phone number of some guy, who in turn, gave me another guy\u2019s number. A chain of plausible deniability, I guess. I texted the guy.\n\n\u201cHey Wayne, my name is Joe. This guy Ken gave me Rico\u2019s number who gave me your number. I\u2019m looking for some product.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, just trying to get jacked.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019d recommend running some test and some TREN. I\u2019ll give you some stuff for a PCT afterward and a special bonus. Give you 10 weeks worth for $250.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds good. When and where can I pick up?\u201d I texted.\n\nI really had no idea what I was doing and decided to just trust the guy. I Googled some of the compounds he\u2019d referred to and learned that Trenbolone is an anabolic agent originally designed to beef up meat cattle. Perfect, I thought. Before I knew it, I was driving to meet this random guy at a gas station towards Raleigh.\n\n\n\nAt the gas station, I spotted a shitty, dented Honda Element that matched the description the guy had given me. He was parked next to the vacuum station, far away from the pumps and the convenience store. I pulled my vehicle in behind his, making it look like I was waiting to use the vacuum myself. I got out of my vehicle and spotted a short, jacked dude in a hoodie.\n\n\u201cHey, are you Wayne?\u201d I said. The short, jacked dude with a thick beard looked at me with a sideways glance.\n\n\u201cYou here for the gear?\u201d he said. His lack of subtly worried me, but I still appreciated his rhyme. This was obviously a legit businessman.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nHe motioned for me to come over towards the passenger door facing away from the gas station. In the back he had a shoebox filled with a bunch of needles, vials, and pills. \u201cAlright my dude, so this here is TREN.\u201d He picked up an unmarked vial with a brackish orange fluid inside of it. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to do about one milliliter twice a week. It should be about 250 milligrams a milliliter\u2026 And FYI, these have a little bit of a bite to them\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean bite?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey sting a bit, but you\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d Wayne said, which instantly assuaged my nerves. Wayne was jacked. I had nothing to fear. Wayne picked up another unmarked vial, this one with a much clearer fluid inside.\n\n\u201cThis here is your test; again, you\u2019re gonna want to shoot this up twice a week, one milliliter. It should be about 250 milligrams per milliliter.\u201d Wayne put the vials back and pulled out a bag full of little white pills. \u201cThese are your PCT, the big ones are Clomid, and the small ones are Nolvadex. Two weeks after your last injection, you\u2019re gonna want to start off by taking two of each per day for one week. Then take one of each per day until you are out of pills. This should get your testicles back up and running.\u201d Wayne put the bag back into the shoe box.\n\nGet my testicles back up and running? Maybe I hadn\u2019t thought this through completely. I had to decide quickly.\n\n\u201cAre these all coming from a pharmacy? What\u2019s your source?\u201d I asked, feeling like a very savvy consumer for having asked such a question.\n\nWayne shook his head. \u201cThe pills are prescribed\u2014pulled them from my personal prescription. The others though, I cooked up myself.\u201d Wayne said.\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 are you like a chemist or something?\u201d I asked, stupidly.\n\n\u201cNo, I just watch a lot of YouTube and read a lot of Reddit. Ordered the raw chemicals from China and mixed them in my garage,\u201d Wayne said nonchalantly, giving me a slight shrug of his shoulders as if to say it was no big deal.\n\n\u201cAnd this is what you use?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Wayne said. If it\u2019s good enough for Wayne, it\u2019s good enough for Joe. Wayne reached back into the shoe box and procured a Ziplock bag full of giant red and white-looking horse pills. A big smile came across Wayne\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna love these, my dude. These here are a special concoction of my own design. They each contain 100mg of Viagra, 100mg of Cialis, and 300mg of caffeine. You will fuck like a machine and get a sick pump. I call them Dick Bombs.\u201d Wayne chuckled. He handed me the bag, which to me glowed like the Ark of the Covenant. I beheld these wonders of medical engineering, and in an instant, all of my doubts and concerns about Wayne\u2019s products dissipated.\n\n\u201cWayne, you deserve a Nobel prize,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHahaha, yeah, you\u2019re gonna love \u2018em, bro. Anyways my dude, good meeting you. If you need anything from me, feel free to hit me up,\u201d Wayne said, handing me the box. After giving him my payment, he gave me a vigorous shake with his meaty hand and sped off in his piece-of-shit Honda. I drove home, feeling like a new era had begun in the life of Joe, already daydreaming about the jacked sex god that I would become.\n\n\n\nUpon return to the barracks, I found a place to stash the roids, where I figured the SF cadre would never look. I quickly got on Google and began to research how to properly cycle the compounds I had been given. Luckily the internet is chock full of forums, where various individuals discuss their cycles and how they went. Interestingly, in many of these forums, along with the username and comment, they also list body measurements along with a picture of the commentator. I sifted through lots of advice with no idea how to discern good from bad, until I decided that I would simply listen to the guys with the biggest bicep measurements. From my \u201cresearch\u201d I determined that Wayne\u2019s prescribed cycle wasn\u2019t particularly crazy or anything.\n\n\n\nThe next night I decided it was time to do it. I pulled up a YouTube video of a guy demoing how to inject steroids into the quadriceps. I chose the quadriceps because it seemed like it would be easier to put the needle in the right place, and it wouldn\u2019t require awkwardly twisting around, as it would if I were to inject into my ass.\n\nFeeling very nervous, I set about sterilizing the injection site, and loading up a syringe. I\u2019d read that you could inject as much as two milliliters in any one injection, and that you could load both compounds into a single syringe. So I took the needle, inserted it into the vial of testosterone, and very slowly and painfully drew up the fluid with the 26-gauge needle. This took forever, and I wondered if I was doing it wrong, until at long last it hit the one milliliter mark. I then took the same needle stuck it into the bottle of TREN, and drew the rusty liquid into the syringe. This fluid was thick and flowed more slowly.\n\nFinally, I had two milliliters loaded up with steroids. I cleared the syringe of excess air as I learned from YouTube. Then I rewatched the video to ensure that I was targeting the correct portion of my quad. I positioned the 1.5-inch needle above the spot, like the killer in a slasher film, at a ninety-degree angle. I took a deep inhale. Sweat had beaded on my forehead as I pushed the needle towards my leg. The needle shook in the air; my hand trembled like I was having a fucking seizure. I felt like I suddenly had cerebral palsy. My head was feeling light. *Maybe I should back out of this before something bad happens,* I thought. *Don\u2019t be a fucking bitch,* another part of me responded. And I shakily drove that needle into my leg.\n\nAt first the skin indented; the needle didn\u2019t puncture. It turns out I had probably dulled it after inserting it into two different vials. I pushed a bit harder and punctured the skin, driving it fully into my quad. Nausea hit me immediately, and I thought I might pass out. Then my quad spasmed, like I had hit a nerve or something, but there was no blood or anything. I depressed the plunger and felt the two milliliters of fluid slowly pump into my quadriceps. It was a warm sensation at first, followed by a mild burning feeling. Wayne did say it would have a bit of \u201cbite.\u201d Despite this, I fully depressed the plunger and pumped it all in, then shakily withdrew the needle. I did it quickly because I feared snapping off the needle beneath the skin, which would\u2019ve made a very awkward trip to the ER. After disposing the needle, I sat back and tried to catch my breath. I felt sweaty and ill but was relieved to have survived the experience. And it would all be worth it. I would look back and laugh at this after I\u2019d become a jacked sex god.\n\n\n\nThe next day, I awoke, and felt a sharp pain in my quad where I injected. I looked at the site and saw that it had grown red and inflamed. I stood up out of my bed and instantly my right leg buckled. A hot pain radiated up and down my quad emanating from the injection site. *Fuck fuck fuck,* I thought. I hobbled over to the bathroom to get a better look at it. I for sure had a knot in my quad and it hurt like a motherfucker. I did some Googling, and it seemed unlikely that an infection could\u2019ve taken hold this fast, which was my chief concern. It was six in the morning when I began to text and call Wayne repeatedly.\n\n\u201cHelllooooo?\u201d\n\n\u201cWayne, its Joe, from yesterday. I injected some into my quad, and now I\u2019ve got a huge knot in my quad that\u2019s a bit red, and I can\u2019t fucking walk,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, bro, like I said, it\u2019s got a bit of bite to it,\u201d Wayne said.\n\n\u201cA bit of bite? This shit hurts real bad, dude,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, the quad is sensitive, and your body just needs to get used to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s not an infection or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, just give it a couple of days, bro, and inject it into your ass next time. Later, dude.\u201d Wayne hung up on me.\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d I thought that Wayne seemed pretty confident. Then I remembered that Wayne is jacked, and I hoped that I hadn\u2019t just sounded like a little bitch. So I decided not to worry about it. I\u2019d keep an eye on it and just tough it out for a few days.\n\n\n\nI hobbled for about a week. I told everyone that I\u2019d just twisted my ankle, which miraculously got me out of some PT. I carried on injecting the vile mixture, trying various other spots after attempting my ass, which I found caused both of my ass cheeks to hurt so bad that I couldn\u2019t sit comfortably. After this I attempted my shoulders, which had the unfortunate side effect of rendering me unable to lift my arm. *I\u2019ll get used to it,* I thought.\n\nIt turns out that Wayne was full of shit. After several weeks, I wasn\u2019t getting used to it all. I was just in pain, sweaty, and murderously horny. Let me tell you, if I wasn\u2019t engaged in cadre organized bullshit, I was swiping right on Tinder like it was my full-time job.\n\n\n\nI was on a date with this blonde bimbo in Raleigh. It seemed to be going pretty well. We\u2019d just finished dinner and we were about to head back to her place. I snuck off into the bathroom and fished inside of my pocket until I grasped one of the Dick Bombs that Wayne had given me. The huge red and white homemade pill shone with the promise of a wild night. I downed it, then returned to my date and began to drive us back to her place.\n\nOn the drive back she pats my thigh, a promising sign. Fifteen minutes into the drive, I begin to get a head rush\u2014must be the caffeine. Shortly thereafter, I began to feel a little congested, like my nose was constricting. Then I developed a pounding headache and a rock-hard erection, and my heart began to pound. I thought I might be about to have a heart attack, but I played cool, not wanting to ruin my chances with bimbo.\n\n\n\nWe arrived at her place and she invited me inside. She pulled me into a bedroom that did not have a bed. We made out. We were on the floor, my pants were down, but underwear was on, and she was in the same configuration. She was straddling on top of me, grinding her panty-covered pussy against my dick, and making out with me like her life depended on it.\n\nThings seemed to be going well. I felt like my cock was about to tear through my underwear and through her panties, so I began to remove them. She stopped me.\n\n\u201cNot on a first date buddy,\u201d she said, then continued to make out with me. My headache had not dissipated, and my cock was so hard I worried that I was going to rupture a vein\u2014I hoped she was at least impressed by it. I tried not to think about it or panic, and proceeded to make out with her for quite some time.\n\nShe didn\u2019t want me to go, and in fact I\u2019m quite sure she would\u2019ve made out with me all night, but I\u2019m not in high school. I was pretty certain that if I didn\u2019t cum soon, that my dick might actually explode. I went back to my barracks and rubbed one out.\n\nOnce I was done, my dick was still hard. I laid on my side with my dick erect and rigid like a fucking kickstand all night.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, I woke up with the most epic morning wood of my life. I see that I have a text on my phone.\n\n\u201cYou should head on over and have breakfast at my place. I look forward to our second date ;)\u201d the bimbo texted me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll head on over,\u201d I responded.\n\nI grabbed an overnight bag and reached for the Dick Bombs in my drawer. I studied the red and white pill, and wondered whether it would be wise to consume another one. This chick was going to be voracious\u2014I knew that I would get laid. She was like a high-school-girl-at-prom kind of horny. Wisely, I knocked back another pill and washed it down with a full bottle of Gatorade. I now had somewhere around 200mg of Viagra, 200mg of Cialis, and somewhere between 350 to 600mg of caffeine pumping through my veins. Oh, and of course the Trenbolone.\n\n\n\nTurns out, the bitch was a liar. There was no breakfast; I got mauled by a girl in lingerie as soon as I crossed the threshold. I carried her to the room, ripped off her panties, which were already wet, condomed up, and thrust into her. My head was throbbing. I could feel my heart beat in my eyes, face, and cock, which literally jumped with each pulsation. I was full of energy and still horny from last night. We started hard. She was squirting all over me, making a fucking mess of the bed. She came, I came. She was delighted to see I was still hard and began blowing me, though she really didn\u2019t need to, then slid me inside her again.\n\nMy cock was so hard that it was tearing through condoms. She orgasmed as my high velocity nut smacked into her uterus. She was loving it and fucking insatiable. Five times in a row we went, without stopping, and I was still hard.\n\n\n\nI could no longer tell if my cock was hurting from the rough sex or from the copious amounts of drugs pumping through my system. Either way, I felt fairly certain that I was facing a medical emergency and needed to do something about it. I did notice that the pain seemed to abate after I came, so I decided that I just needed to keep cumming.\n\nShe had gone to the kitchen to rehydrate. I came up behind her and grabbed her by the hair, she hurriedly hiked down her pants, and I bent her over and fucked her again.\n\nPussy juice and cum dribbled onto the floor, and I was beginning to lose my footing. We fucked again on the table, then the couch, the bed two more times, she stopped to take some Motrin, then we did it some more, standing, laying, kneeling, acrobatic fucking. I was giving her everything I had, and she was enduring it, somehow. She was an insatiable sex fiend. I had to slay her.\n\nWe\u2019d quiver, cum, and collapse, only for her to crawl towards me like some heroin addict saying \u201cagain.\u201d Again, we\u2019d got to the point where it became just as much about defeating her as it was about relieving my never-ending erection.\n\nWhen all was said and done, we fucked well north of twenty times in a twenty-four-hour period. She laid on her side in ecstatic pain, clutching her abdomen and icing her pussy. I had conquered her. I\u2019d slain my Grendel.\n\nUnfortunately, she was decommissioned for a little over a week, bleeding and sore as shit, and her stomach hurt. The poor girl had to call in sick from work for the week. The rest of our short time together was quite lame.\n\nI\u2019d survived the experience, even though I\u2019d overdosed on Dick Bomb. I did have a pretty wicked nose bleed that lasted a couple of days, and my body was still fucking hurting from all the bullshit juice Wayne had given me.\n\nEven with all that, I felt like an absolute stud, and pitied whatever poor fucking sap dated her next.\n\n\n\n\u00a0To read more check out \"Department Of Degenerates\" by Specialist Joe.

OC/CC or OC/OC", "content": "Hey everybody! I hope you\u2019re all doing well, and if it\u2019s a lil tough for you I sincerely hope it improves! \n\nToday, I\u2019m looking for somebody to play a canon female character from the world of My Hero Academia against a male original character of my own! More specifically some characters I\u2019m looking for are as follows from most to least interested; Momo Yaoyorozu, Nejire Hado, Rumi Usagiyama/Mirko, Kyoka Jiro, or Mina Ashido! If you have anyone else you want to play as though that would be fine by me, those are just my preferences. If you can play a female canon character for me, then I\u2019d be happy to play any male canon character for you! However I will NOT play canon ships, sorry. \nI also might be down to do some OC/OC pairings depending on who your character is and if I think they\u2019d mesh well with mine, though canon is preferred. \n\nFor the story and plot itself, I\u2019m not picky at all. I\u2019m very open to any ideas or whatever preferences you have as long as romance is an integral part of the story. I\u2019m also open to atypical kinds of romance like on-again-off-again, love triangles, etc. I would love to hear your ideas and thoughts, it makes everything more fun! Usually I like to have some form of action involved, with a main villain and such, but we can discuss and come up with something together! \n\nGenerally what I look for in a roleplay partner is somebody I can converse with. I love talking about our characters and the story and all that, especially their interactions. Fleshing characters out and creating complex dynamics and all of that is probably my favorite thing about roleplay, I find it extremely gratifying to have our own unique story to tell. So if you\u2019re the kinda person who likes chatting about the story OOC, then I think we\u2019ll get along beautifully. Creativity and flexibility are huge for me, because I love it when you guys bring your own ideas and twists to spice it all up. Unorthodox characters and stuff are my JAM, I love weird ideas and unusual characters. \nBut above all else I value honesty. If you don\u2019t like how I\u2019m playing a canon character for you, please tell me. If you don\u2019t like one of my OCs, please tell me. If you just aren\u2019t into the roleplay, please tell me. We can always figure it out. At the end of the day this is purely entertainment, and if you aren\u2019t being entertained then I want to fix that! \n\nIn terms of writing ability and such, I\u2019m not super picky. What I ask of you is that you can consistently do 2-3 paragraphs per response, be decently detailed, and have good grammar. You can probably guess by my writing here, I\u2019m not a stickler with grammar but it can definitely make or break a story. Personally I tend to attempt to write 2-3 paragraphs per response, mostly depending on what\u2019s required. 1 paragraph is fine too, as long as it\u2019s moving the story forward! \n\nI\u2019ll warn you now, however, that I tend to get busy pretty easily between work and friends and other stuff. But I always try to crank out a few responses a day, and if I don\u2019t think I can do that then I\u2019ll give you a heads up to the best of my ability!

OC/CC or OC/OC", "content": "Hey everybody! I hope you\u2019re all doing well, and if it\u2019s a lil tough for you I sincerely hope it improves! \n\nToday, I\u2019m looking for somebody to play a canon female character from the world of My Hero Academia against a male original character of my own! More specifically some characters I\u2019m looking for are as follows from most to least interested; Momo Yaoyorozu, Nejire Hado, Rumi Usagiyama/Mirko, Kyoka Jiro, or Mina Ashido! If you have anyone else you want to play as though that would be fine by me, those are just my preferences. If you can play a female canon character for me, then I\u2019d be happy to play any male canon character for you! However I will NOT play canon ships, sorry. \nI also might be down to do some OC/OC pairings depending on who your character is and if I think they\u2019d mesh well with mine, though canon is preferred. \n\nFor the story and plot itself, I\u2019m not picky at all. I\u2019m very open to any ideas or whatever preferences you have as long as romance is an integral part of the story. I\u2019m also open to atypical kinds of romance like on-again-off-again, love triangles, etc. I would love to hear your ideas and thoughts, it makes everything more fun! Usually I like to have some form of action involved, with a main villain and such, but we can discuss and come up with something together! \n\nGenerally what I look for in a roleplay partner is somebody I can converse with. I love talking about our characters and the story and all that, especially their interactions. Fleshing characters out and creating complex dynamics and all of that is probably my favorite thing about roleplay, I find it extremely gratifying to have our own unique story to tell. So if you\u2019re the kinda person who likes chatting about the story OOC, then I think we\u2019ll get along beautifully. Creativity and flexibility are huge for me, because I love it when you guys bring your own ideas and twists to spice it all up. Unorthodox characters and stuff are my JAM, I love weird ideas and unusual characters. \nBut above all else I value honesty. If you don\u2019t like how I\u2019m playing a canon character for you, please tell me. If you don\u2019t like one of my OCs, please tell me. If you just aren\u2019t into the roleplay, please tell me. We can always figure it out. At the end of the day this is purely entertainment, and if you aren\u2019t being entertained then I want to fix that! \n\nIn terms of writing ability and such, I\u2019m not super picky. What I ask of you is that you can consistently do 2-3 paragraphs per response, be decently detailed, and have good grammar. You can probably guess by my writing here, I\u2019m not a stickler with grammar but it can definitely make or break a story. Personally I tend to attempt to write 2-3 paragraphs per response, mostly depending on what\u2019s required. 1 paragraph is fine too, as long as it\u2019s moving the story forward! \n\nI\u2019ll warn you now, however, that I tend to get busy pretty easily between work and friends and other stuff. But I always try to crank out a few responses a day, and if I don\u2019t think I can do that then I\u2019ll give you a heads up to the best of my ability!

I really need a job that pays something. I'm very good at coding but my GPA is weak because I don't go to class enough. It's a private school with a not go great reputation for CS so I can't get a lot of interviews. So my school has a hackathon and I joined a team. I didn't know the other guys and they pretty much left me alone most of the time. I started playing with Google Germini just to kill time mostly. I tried to get it to write some malware to mess with my teammates but it's not really made for that kind of thing so I just started googling different kinds of malware and I ended up on some phishing sites. I made a phishing email and sent it to one of the hackathon judges who worked for a F1000 company in HR or something. They were giving away video cards and holding mock interviews during the hackathon. I tried the mock interview so I got a little intel about the person. Anyway, they fell for the phishing email and I acquired their user name and password. I was able to log into the HR portal for the company. From there I made an offer to myself and then I went to my email and accepted it. The HR software added me to a cohort and gave me a start date. I could even see the other people in the cohort so I emailed a few of them to let them know I was one of them. Now I have a job and it seems legit but I wasn't able to figure out how to change the job title so I think I am an Associate Software Engineer. I am afraid to go back into the system and try to change it at this point. I don't know if I should just show up on my start day and roll with it. Maybe I have nothing to lose any way.

First Impressions Happen Online\n\nWhen someone searches for a service or product locally, they\u2019re likely to start with a Google search. In fact, studies show that **76% of people** who search for something nearby visit a business within a day. If your GMB profile doesn\u2019t show up in the top results, potential customers won\u2019t even know you exist. Your business could be incredible, but if it\u2019s not visible online, you\u2019re losing out.\n\n# 2. Build Trust and Credibility\n\nWhen you rank higher on Google My Business, you\u2019re more likely to be seen as trustworthy. Consumers are more likely to visit or choose a business that ranks higher because it gives the impression of being more established and reliable. A complete, optimized GMB profile with consistent updates, positive reviews, and relevant photos builds credibility and makes your business more attractive to potential customers.\n\n# 3. It\u2019s Free Marketing!\n\nOne of the best parts of using Google My Business is that it\u2019s a **free marketing tool**. By simply optimizing your profile, you can significantly increase your business\u2019s visibility. This means more customers finding you through Google Search and Google Maps without spending money on ads. The more optimized your profile, the better your chances of appearing in the local 3-pack \u2013 the top three businesses that appear in local search results.\n\n# 4. Local SEO Equals Local Customers\n\nGoogle\u2019s algorithms prioritize local businesses in their search results when users look for nearby services. This means that having an optimized GMB profile helps your business show up when it matters most \u2013 when potential customers are searching for businesses in your area. Your GMB profile is an essential part of your **Local SEO strategy**, and ranking well in local search results can drive significant traffic to your website and physical location.\n\n# 5. Increased Customer Engagement\n\nDid you know that Google My Business offers features that allow customers to engage directly with your business? From leaving reviews and booking appointments to messaging your business directly, GMB makes it easy for customers to take action. A well-optimized profile not only attracts more views but also encourages more interaction. The more active your GMB profile, the more likely customers will engage with it.\n\n# 6. Insights and Analytics\n\nGMB provides valuable insights into how customers are finding and interacting with your business. You can track how many people are viewing your profile, how they\u2019re finding you, and what actions they\u2019re taking (like visiting your website or requesting directions). This data helps you continuously improve your strategy, ensuring your business stays competitive and visible.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nYour business\u2019s visibility on Google My Business can be the difference between gaining a new customer or losing them to a competitor. To rank higher, focus on optimizing every element of your GMB profile \u2013 from accurate business information to positive reviews and engaging posts. With the right strategy, you\u2019ll see your local visibility grow, bringing in more foot traffic and online interactions.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet, start by claiming your GMB profile, optimizing it, and watch your business rank higher and thrive!\n\n#GoogleMyBusiness #LocalSEO #BusinessGrowth #GMBOptimization #DigitalMarketing"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "GOOGL", "page_content": {"title": "Can you clean wood with Lysol wipes?

Unlike many web design agencies who are experts in MSU (making stuff up) and regularly cut corners at clients\u2019 expenses (but to their quick payday), Jeremy guarantees his work.  \n\nOne of the reasons why Jeremy can stand behind his work is because his team only implements strategies for their clients after they\u2019ve been thoroughly tested and proven to produce consistent results. \n\n Jeremy McGilvrey\u2019s web design agency is committed to delivering exceptional service to their clients.
