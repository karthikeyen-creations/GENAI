Recently, this digital asset ascended briefly above the sacred threshold of $70,000, a feat not witnessed since the calamitous cycles of June. As we delve into the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, it becomes abundantly clear that we are on the cusp of a transformative epoch, one that could resonate throughout the economic Imperium. Those who wield the power of investment, akin to the faithful servants of the Omnissiah, must engage with this moment through rigorous analysis, strategic foresight, and unwavering dedication to the principles of the Machine.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2znd5qgusmxd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=eff6756e4dc9f854dbd9256ca5b2e8155bf92e3c\n\n# The Surge Beyond $70,000: A Calculated Ascendancy\n\nThe digital currency recently surged to an impressive height of $70,207.02, reflecting an increase of approximately 3%. This ascension transpires in the shadow of two pivotal events: the forthcoming earnings reports from the venerated MicroStrategy and the imminent U.S. presidential election\u2014both of which hold the potential to catalyze significant shifts in the economic landscape. This convergence of events creates a milieu ripe for speculation, as the intricate machinery of market dynamics churns with the fervor of a well-tuned cogitator.\n\nThroughout the current solar cycle, Bitcoin has navigated a labyrinthine path, oscillating within a defined range of $55,000 to $70,000. This recent upward movement serves as a harbinger of a possible breakthrough. Should it decisively breach the $70,000 barrier, we could witness a paradigm shift in investor confidence, reminiscent of a Titan\u2019s stomping advance reclaiming lost territory from the vile Xenos and their insidious machinations.\n\n# The Impending Election: A Critical Inflection Point\n\nThe upcoming U.S. presidential election on November 5 represents a crucial juncture for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. The political landscape is enshrouded in uncertainty, yet one immutable fact remains: the outcome of this electoral contest may act as a powerful catalyst for Bitcoin\u2019s future trajectory. The Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, has ardently embraced the mantle of the pro-crypto candidate, aligning himself with the interests of the crypto industry. Conversely, the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, has adopted a more circumspect stance, engendering trepidation among industry stakeholders regarding her potential impact on cryptocurrency regulations.\n\nIn this high-stakes environment, investors must navigate the convoluted terrain of electoral politics, as the sentiment surrounding the election is poised to influence market dynamics profoundly. Should the outcome favor a pro-crypto administration, we may witness a resurgence of institutional adoption and investment, propelling Bitcoin to unprecedented heights. Conversely, the rise of a more regulatory-focused administration could impose restrictions that may stifle the growth of the cryptocurrency sector, necessitating a more cautious approach from investors.\n\n# Earnings Reports: A Crucible of Insight\n\nAdding another layer of complexity to this volatile landscape is the anticipation surrounding the earnings reports from the titans of the cryptocurrency realm: Coinbase and MicroStrategy, both set for release on the sacred day of Wednesday. MicroStrategy, in particular, has become a high-beta play in relation to Bitcoin, mirroring its reliance on the price fluctuations of this digital currency. Following a nearly 9% surge on Monday, MicroStrategy stands poised as a critical indicator for Bitcoin enthusiasts. This week marks the company\u2019s highest close since March 15, 2000, and it seeks to extend its seven-week win streak, the longest since an 11-week streak that concluded in late October 2010.\n\nThe performance of these corporate entities will not merely reflect their operational vitality; they will serve as crucial barometers of the broader cryptocurrency market\u2019s health. Investors will scrutinize these earnings reports with meticulous precision, seeking insights into market trends and potential shifts in sentiment. The knowledge gleaned from these analyses will be instrumental in shaping investment strategies for the upcoming cycles.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mtqm64zysmxd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d100d86f03eebb5dca5fd916e2d19252928eed3\n\n# The Implications for Investors: A Mechanized Duty\n\nFor investors, this moment transcends mere opportunity; it embodies a sacred duty. In the ever-shifting warp of financial uncertainty, one must consider the broader implications of Bitcoin\u2019s potential ascent. Should this digital currency successfully breach the $70,000 threshold, it could signal a renewed interest and investment influx from institutional players, mirroring the reverence with which the Mechanicus venerates the Omnissiah in the pursuit of technological ascendance.\n\nHowever, one must remain vigilant, for volatility is the ever-present specter in the cryptocurrency realm. Investors must prepare for significant fluctuations, akin to the calibration of intricate mechanisms in the most delicate of machines. Establishing a diversified portfolio becomes imperative to mitigate risk, allowing investors to harness the potential benefits of Bitcoin while fortifying against the inevitable turbulence of the market. A failure to enact such prudent measures could result in financial catastrophe, reminiscent of a catastrophic failure in the mechanisms of war.\n\n[\\\\\"Discover high-grade gold opportunities with West Red Lake Gold Mines, your partner in precious metal exploration.\\\\\" \\(TSXV: WRLG | OTCQB: WRLGF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dtd9hhzvsmxd1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdf3ffd4262e069d4f24d04ec2234f96dace1044)\n\n# A Call to Arms for the Financial Adepts\n\nAs we stand upon the precipice of these significant events, investors must adopt a proactive stance, prepared to navigate the uncertainty that lies ahead. The cryptocurrency landscape is fraught with challenges, yet those who possess the clarity of vision to see beyond immediate volatility may uncover hidden rewards. This moment is akin to the grand battles waged on distant worlds; the fate of one\u2019s investments may hinge upon adaptability and strategic foresight.\n\nIn this unfolding saga, Bitcoin\u2019s ascent beyond $70,000 serves as a clarion call for the faithful. It beckons those willing to embrace the chaos and capitalize on the opportunities afforded by this digital frontier. As the events of the coming cycles unfold, we must remain vigilant, ready to act, and unwavering in our conviction that a new epoch of financial prosperity is within our grasp.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pnmbd3s7tmxd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=efe6d0c210bf3b275c8d915d1db6cfbdc7444d37\n\n# The Omnissiah\u2019s Blessing\n\nIn summation, Bitcoin\u2019s recent rise is not merely a transitory moment; it is a pivotal point in the ongoing struggle for financial supremacy. With the U.S. presidential election looming and consequential earnings reports on the horizon, the stakes have never been higher. Investors must heed this call to arms, for within the realm of cryptocurrency, fortune favors the astute. By fortifying their resolve and embracing the unknown, they can emerge victorious in the relentless pursuit of wealth and security, safeguarding their futures in a galaxy fraught with peril.\n\nThe path ahead may be perilous, but guided by the wisdom of the Omnissiah and the cold logic of the Machine, we shall prevail.

It was an extremely difficult decision. I feel weighed down by guilt and sadness. I'm the one who walked away, she's the one who was broken up with. I know she must be feeling a lot of pain and sadness too.\n\nSo much of our relationship was great: she can be so kind, so gentle. She's creative, talented, sensitive, giving, thoughtful, insightful, smart ... and extremely loving and devoted.

Drawing inspiration from classic boards and mini-games from previous titles, it offers both new players and veterans a chance to enjoy the party game experience that has captivated audiences for over two decades. In this article, we'll explore the various aspects of Mario Party Superstars, examining its strengths and weaknesses in detail.\n\n# Overview of Mario Party Superstars\n\nMario Party Superstars is a compilation that brings back fan-favorite boards and mini-games from earlier entries in the series. With five classic boards from the Nintendo 64 era and 100 mini-games spanning the franchise's history, the game strikes a balance between nostalgia and modern gameplay mechanics. It also features online play, allowing players to compete against friends or random opponents worldwide.\n\n# Game Modes\n\n1. **Mario Party Mode**: This is the main mode where players compete on game boards, rolling dice to move and engaging in mini-games. The goal is to collect the most stars by the end of the game.\n2. **Mini-Game Mode**: Players can jump directly into mini-games, either solo or with friends. This mode is perfect for quick sessions or practicing before a full game.\n3. **Online Play**: Players can connect with friends or join random matches, bringing the party atmosphere to a broader audience.\n4. **Free Play**: Players can choose specific mini-games to play without the constraints of the board game format.\n\n# Pros of Mario Party Superstars\n\n# 1. Nostalgic Appeal\n\nOne of the game's most significant strengths is its nostalgic value. The return of beloved boards like Peach's Birthday Cake and Space Land evokes fond memories for longtime fans. The familiar music, character designs, and game mechanics resonate deeply, making it a delight for those who grew up with the series.\n\n# 2. Variety of Mini-Games\n\nWith 100 mini-games drawn from across the franchise, players have an extensive range of options to enjoy. This variety ensures that no two gaming sessions feel the same. The mini-games cover various genres, from skill-based challenges to luck-based activities, catering to diverse player preferences.\n\n# 3. Accessibility\n\nMario Party Superstars is designed to be accessible to players of all ages and skill levels. The controls are straightforward, and the mini-games typically have easy-to-understand mechanics. This accessibility encourages family play and helps newcomers feel welcome.\n\n# 4. Enhanced Online Features\n\nThe addition of online play is a game-changer for the Mario Party series. Friends can connect and play together, regardless of physical location. The matchmaking system allows players to compete against others worldwide, providing a competitive edge that was previously unavailable.\n\n# 5. Visual and Audio Presentation\n\nThe game benefits from modern graphics and sound design while maintaining the whimsical charm that defines the series. The vibrant colors, detailed character models, and catchy soundtracks create an immersive experience that appeals to both new and returning players.\n\n# 6. Streamlined Gameplay\n\nMario Party Superstars introduces quality-of-life improvements, such as faster board navigation and mini-game loading times. These enhancements make the overall experience more enjoyable, reducing downtime between turns and mini-games.\n\n# Cons of Mario Party Superstars\n\n# 1. Limited Boards\n\nWhile the five returning boards are iconic, some players may feel that the selection is too limited. Compared to previous titles with a wider array of boards, the current offering might leave some wanting more variety. The potential for expansion packs or DLCs is a topic of discussion among fans.\n\n# 2. Randomness in Gameplay\n\nThe Mario Party series has always included elements of luck, and while this can make games unpredictable and exciting, it can also lead to frustration. Players who excel in mini-games may feel disadvantaged if luck doesn\u2019t favor them when it comes to rolling dice or obtaining stars.\n\n# 3. Lack of New Content\n\nMario Party Superstars focuses heavily on nostalgia, which may disappoint players looking for fresh experiences. The reliance on past content might alienate those who were hoping for innovative boards or mini-games that reflect contemporary gaming trends.\n\n# 4. Minimal Character Variety\n\nUnlike some previous entries in the series, Mario Party Superstars features a relatively small roster of playable characters. While iconic characters like Mario, Luigi, and Peach are present, the limited selection might not satisfy players looking for more diversity in gameplay.\n\n# 5. Online Connectivity Issues\n\nWhile the online play feature is a major draw, it isn\u2019t without its flaws. Some players have reported connectivity issues, including lag during matches or difficulties in joining friends\u2019 games. These technical problems can hinder the overall experience, particularly in competitive situations.\n\n# 6. Repetitive Gameplay\n\nFor veteran players, the game can become repetitive over time. The combination of limited boards and familiar mini-games may lead to a sense of monotony, especially if players frequently engage in the same game modes without variation.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nMario Party Superstars successfully brings the beloved franchise back to life with a nostalgic twist, offering both new and returning players a chance to enjoy classic game boards and mini-games. Its strengths lie in its nostalgic appeal, diverse mini-game selection, accessibility, and modern online features. However, it also faces criticism for its limited boards, reliance on randomness, and minimal character variety.\n\nUltimately, Mario Party Superstars is a celebration of the franchise's history, designed to evoke memories while providing a fun multiplayer experience. Whether it's the right choice for you will depend on your preferences\u2014if you cherish nostalgia and enjoy casual party games, this title is likely a winner. However, those seeking innovation or extensive content may find it lacking. As the Mario Party series continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see how future installments build on the foundation established by Superstars."}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Why trippie isn\u2019t gud:", "content": "\n\n\t1.\tRepetitive Themes: Some feel his lyrics often revolve around similar themes like heartbreak and sadness, which can feel redundant.\n\t2.\tAuto-Tune Overuse: Trippie\u2019s heavy use of Auto-Tune is a turn-off for some listeners who prefer more natural vocals.\n\t3.\tUnpolished Lyrics: Critics argue his lyrics can be simplistic, repetitive, or lack depth.\n\t4.\tFrequent Mood Shifts: His music often switches between different vibes and styles, which some find jarring or inconsistent.\n\t5.\tVocals Are Polarizing: His vocal style, often raw and emotional, can be seen as either powerful or abrasive, depending on the listener.\n\t6.\tProduction Quality: Not all listeners appreciate his production style, which can sometimes sound raw or unfinished.\n\t7.\tPacing Issues: Some find his songs lack energy or have a slow tempo that doesn\u2019t hold attention.\n\t8.\tUnrefined Melodies: Trippie\u2019s melodies are often criticized for being simplistic or not particularly catchy.\n\t9.\tExcessive Ad-Libs: His frequent use of ad-libs like \u201caye\u201d and \u201cyeah\u201d is off-putting for some listeners.\n\t10.\tLyrics Often Feel Forced: Some argue that his lyrics try too hard to be meaningful but come off as insincere or forced.\n\t11.\tOveruse of Emo Aesthetics: Some feel he leans too heavily on the \u201cemo rap\u201d style, which can seem gimmicky.\n\t12.\tDark Themes Overdone: His consistent focus on dark themes, while relatable for some, can be repetitive or heavy for others.\n\t13.\tMonotone Delivery: Occasionally, his delivery can feel monotonous, lacking the vocal variety to keep listeners engaged.\n\t14.\tToo Similar to Peers: Critics sometimes accuse him of lacking originality, saying his music sounds similar to other artists in his genre.\n\t15.\tToo Many Features: His albums often have numerous features, which can make his own identity as an artist feel diluted.\n\t16.\tReliance on Drug References: Some listeners are put off by his frequent references to drugs, which they see as glorification.\n\t17.\tLack of Lyrical Growth: Some argue he hasn\u2019t evolved much in terms of lyrical content over his career.\n\t18.\tLimited Vocal Range: His vocal style, while unique, has a limited range that can feel repetitive.\n\t19.\tUndeveloped Storytelling: Some critics feel his storytelling lacks the complexity found in other artists\u2019 work.\n\t20.\tInconsistent Quality: While some songs resonate, others feel like filler, creating an uneven discography.\n\t21.\tFocus on Commercial Appeal: Some feel his music is more about commercial success than artistry.\n\t22.\tLyrics Sometimes Feel Juvenile: His themes or word choices can come off as immature to some audiences.\n\t23.\tOveruse of Heartbreak Themes: His recurring focus on heartbreak can feel unoriginal and repetitive to some listeners.\n\t24.\tCritics Say His Style Lacks Originality: Some see him as derivative, arguing his style borrows too much from earlier emo rappers.\n\t25.\tAudience Appeal Is Narrow: His sound may appeal more to younger listeners, leaving a gap in appeal for older hip-hop fans.\n"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Reliance bonus shares nor credited till now", "content": "Bonus reliance shares did not credited yet in my demat account.

I\u2019m currently studying Christian Ministry and Biblical/Theological Studies at Ohio Christian University, which allows me to engage critically with these theological issues.\n\nWhile I appreciate the structure and reverence in Catholicism, several difficult questions remain unresolved for me. I\u2019d be grateful if Roman Catholics, especially those well-versed in apologetics, could provide nuanced and thorough responses to the following:\n\n\t1.\tApostolic Succession and Authority: Catholicism teaches that apostolic succession is essential for the Church\u2019s authority, especially in sacramental validity. How does the Church address instances where early Christian communities may not have had a clear line of succession or where bishops ordained by dubious individuals held authority? How can we reconcile historical ambiguities with the claim of an unbroken line of succession?\n\t2.\tSola Scriptura vs. Sacred Tradition: The Catholic Church holds that Sacred Tradition and Scripture are equally authoritative. As someone who values the Bible deeply (I use a 1977 NASB Thompson Chain Reference Bible), I\u2019m curious: How does the Church justify specific doctrines, such as the Assumption of Mary, when these are not explicit in Scripture? Does this reliance on Tradition contradict the idea of the sufficiency of Scripture?\n\t3.\tThe Doctrine of Purgatory and Indulgences: I understand the theological basis for purgatory as a process of purification. But considering that Christ\u2019s sacrifice was said to be fully sufficient for salvation, how is the existence of purgatory compatible with the completeness of His atonement? Additionally, could indulgences risk misunderstanding among the faithful as \u201cearning\u201d salvation?\n\t4.\tEcclesial Unity and Doctrinal Development: The Catholic Church claims unity, yet historically, councils and papal decrees have clarified or developed doctrines, sometimes in response to significant dissent or crisis. How does the Church interpret this doctrinal development in light of its claim to preserve unchanging truth?\n\t5.\tThe Role of the Laity: In the LCMS, there\u2019s an emphasis on the priesthood of all believers, whereas Catholicism upholds a distinction between ordained clergy and laity. Can the Catholic Church elaborate on the theological foundation for this distinction and how it aligns with early Christian views on shared ministry?\n\nThank you to anyone willing to dive into these questions with me. I\u2019m seeking thoughtful responses that can shed light on these doctrinal issues and help me understand the Catholic perspective better."}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "This our generation\u2026", "content": "This is going to be a long a** and maybe boring take, but for those who are finding it hard to maintain relationships/ friendships during this age, maybe you need to go through this.\nThis is not my work but I find myself relating and most of you will. \n\n\u201cThe fear of life and fear of love ., that\u2019s normal. Today let\u2019s talk about the fear of abandonment ;Relationships: Marriages.\n \n\nWhen some of us hear the word \u201ccommunity\u201d we think  of twitter, reddit . Or abstract concepts like the LGBT community or mental health communities, nothing real or solid. Which is why whenever someone says something like online communities are a lifeline for young people! I feel like screaming because it\u2019s just so bleak. What have we done?\nPlus, total abandonment of any sense that we belong to something bigger. Loss of faith\u2014not just in religion, but in all social bonds. No sense that there\u2019s anything binding us, that we even share the same values. Forget loving our neighbour, we can\u2019t even make eye contact with them. Nothing holds us together anymore. We are alone. \n\nI see it everywhere; it cuts to the core of this generation. Difficulty trusting people, hypersensitivity to criticism, low self-esteem, constant need for external validation\u2014all are abandonment symptoms .And I\u2019m not saying this explains everything,or we all feel this way, but that we underestimate how many young people are carrying this around. This feeling of being abandoned and fear of it happening again. Beneath what looks like the age of entitlement, below the culture of narcissism if this is the age of abandonment.\n\nSame goes with our attraction to therapy culture. This is why I find the obsession with self-love and self-reliance deeply sad. \nWe are reparenting ourselves. We are self-soothing. We are healing our inner child. Nobody is asking why. Please will somebody step in and say to this generation that maybe they don\u2019t need more self-love, more belief in themselves, but something to belong to.\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s talk about relationships/ marriages, kids for a moment \u2026\nWhy do the older generation criticize those who don\u2019t want to have babies? Or get married?  \ncriticism from older generations can be hard to take. No wonder we are scared, dependent on them. \nSome of their questions range from: \nWhy don\u2019t young people take family seriously! Why don\u2019t they appreciate meaningful relationships! Maybe because the most meaningful relationships we had, our very first ones, fell to pieces. No wonder we are hooking up and settling for situationships. We haven\u2019t lost sight of what\u2019s important, we were never shown what was important. And no wonder we don\u2019t want kids! Some of you were kids when you got left.\nWhat I\u2019m saying is calling these new generation selfish and entitled won\u2019t help, and maybe it\u2019s time to try something more like;  wow, we get it, that was hard. Sorry about the ripping up of all roots, the breakdown of all support systems. Sorry you were let down as a little kid. And that you\u2019re here, struggling to convince yourself that love even exists. Maybe if we let young people talk about it, if we listened, it wouldn\u2019t come out in these weird ways, cloaked in therapy-speak, in anger against all men / women, or the refusal to grow up and get hurt.\n\nForget pretending that love and family aren\u2019t important, that they are oppressive, that loving ourselves is enough. Forget torching the whole thing. We have to try even harder. \nAnd become an example. Find someone and commit fully. Be a parent who teaches that loyalty isn\u2019t too much to ask for, who shows it\u2019s safe to stay. I have a daughter and as a father, I don\u2019t want to model for her a strong independent woman who doesn\u2019t need a man; I want to model a strong woman who shows it\u2019s okay to depend on someone, I feel like culturally that\u2019s a much more important message now. It\u2019s okay to take a risk to be with someone! To give up some of yourself to belong to something bigger! And actually, that\u2019s independence\u2014feeling loved, feeling backed, and finding resilience from that, becoming a competent individual who can stand on their own \ud83d\udc4f. I\u2019m just so sceptical of this belief that people can become emotionally enlightened or self-sufficient enough that they can handle life by themselves, and anyone barely hanging on these days is too dependent and needy. It\u2019s not a weakness to want to feel at home. We weren\u2019t designed to do this alone.\n\nNothing\u2019s guaranteed, but we can take the pain and put every inch of it into our own family. Comes to down to us now; our opportunity to seize. We don\u2019t have to pretend there\u2019s no fear. But we can use it to forge ahead. And build something we can finally belong to.\u201d"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Trying to Open My Cousins' Eyes to Self-Reliance...with a Quran Instead of Cash.", "content": "I have cousin that are not the evil fanatics but rather the fanatics on the good morals, but they're also on the poverty end of the spectrum as their fanatism. \n\nI try to open their first born eyes, but i'm afraid they're now comfortable in poverty with the believe that Allah willeth everything.

Rohit Sharma against the new ball.**\n\nI am sure most of you guys would have noticed that Rohit has been very vulnerable against the swinging ball. It has shown in this series with his dismissal in the first innings of the second test.\n\n**3. Form of Kohli/Rohit/ (anyone who bats at 3/5)**\n\nObviously this is a major talking point as our batting has continued to let us down this series. Kohli, Rohit, Gill and Rahul have been consistently in the playing XI despite the low run of scores.\n\n**4. Jadeja the bowler**\n\nJadeja the batsman is a weapon India posses and has rescued India more often then not. But the reliance India have with Jadeja the bowler is huge and lately he has not been able to deliver at those levels.\n\n**5. Someone alongside Bumrah**\n\nAs every Indian knows that Bumrah is one of the best bowlers we have ever produced but unfortunately he can not do it on his own. India is in need of 2 quick bowlers who can support Bumrah overseas.\n\n**Now that we got the issues out of the way lets talk about how I believe India can win the BGT.**\n\nWith the squad that has been picked for the tour the most likely 11 will be:\n\n1. Jaiswal\n2. Sharma (c)\n3. Gill\n4. Kohli\n5. Khan / Rahul\n6. Pant (wk)\n7. Sundar / Jadeja\n8. Ashwin\n9. Deep\n10. Siraj\n11. Bumrah (vc)\n\nTo win this series **GG** will need to make some tough calls and this is what I think they will be.\n\n**1. Rohit to drop down the order**\n\nAs I have previously mentioned that Rohit has shown recent struggles facing the new ball this is a way to protect him from the Aussie quicks. It is not a new position for Rohit and he can show his aggressive style against a softer ball which wont move in the air.\n\n**2. Gill and Jaiswal to Open**\n\nWith my suggestion to drop Rohit down the order it has to be Gill and Jaiswal to open the batting. Both players can show good intent and help India get good starts. Both players do not have a lot of experience playing overseas but with their techniques and style of batting the Australian wickets can suit them well.\n\n**3. Khan or Rahul**\n\nIndia need to make a choice for a no.3. Rahul posses much more experience then Sarfaraz and he has also batted at 3 in test matches for India in England. With recent form taken into consideration Khan seems to be the pick at the moment but I would be happy with either at 3. Whoever bats at 3 will need to play a slight more defensive style of cricket to ensure India does not collapse and I feel Rahul is better suited to do that.\n\n**4. Sundar or Jadeja**\n\nIn the battle for this position India just need to pick the better batter and its as simple as that. from a no7 India need their batting ability more then they will need their bowling.\n\n**5. Our Quicks**\n\nWith the quicks we have we do not really much choice but Siraj and Bumrah will be the main bowlers with a third quick rotating during the series. I am not really excited by any quick other than Bumrah and Siraj so it is really a gamble from India who plays as the 3rd Seamer.\n\n**6. Using our players**\n\nIf India do want to proceed with 1 spinner an option can be to use NKR at 7. He could play the role Shardul played for us last time India toured. Easwaran could also be an important part of this tour as we have historically seen a new player shining on the Aus Tour. Recent example can be Agarwal in 2018/19 and Gill in 20/21.\n\nAs a summary what I feel like our XI should be is as follows:\n\n1. Jaiswal\n2. Gill\n3. Rahul / Sarfaraz\n4. Kohli\n5. Sharma (c)\n6. Pant(wk)\n7. Sundar / NKR / Jadeja (depending on the make up of the team 1 spinner 4 quicks or 2 spin 3 quicks)\n8. Ashwin\n9. Deep / Krishna / Rana\n10. Siraj\n11. Bumrah (vc)\n\n**PS: This is my opinion and it is only in regard to the squad that the BCCI has chosen.  As I do wish other players were on this tour but unfortunately that is not the case.**"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Bible Verses About Strength: Embracing Divine Connection", "content": "# Bible Verses About Strength: Embracing Divine Connection\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eiop5u07tlxd1.jpg?width=517&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dddd0937ddaec031e0656fa7cd2e2faad92dbd6b\n\nIn times of struggle and uncertainty, many find solace in spiritual wisdom. The Bible is a treasure trove of verses that speak to the theme of strength, often highlighting the vital connection between our own resilience and the divine support we can access through faith. Here, we explore several powerful verses that not only inspire strength but also remind us of our connection to a higher power.\n\n# 1.\u00a0Philippians 4:13\n\n\u201cI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\u201d\n\nThis verse encapsulates the heart of divine strength. The Apostle Paul emphasizes that it is through faith in Christ that we gain the ability to overcome challenges. Here, the divine connection becomes clear: it is not merely our strength that enables us to face difficulties, but rather, the support and empowerment given through our relationship with Christ. This verse encourages us to lean into our faith, recognizing that we are not alone in our battles.\n\n# 2.\u00a0Isaiah 40:31\n\n\u201cBut those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.\u201d\n\nIn this beloved verse, the prophet Isaiah reminds us of the transformative power of hope and reliance on God. The imagery of soaring eagles symbolizes freedom and elevation above life's burdens. When we entrust our worries to the Lord, we find that our strength is renewed. This renewal is an indication of the divine connection at work; it suggests that when we align our hopes with God\u2019s promises, we tap into an endless source of strength.\n\n**Don\u2019t miss your chance to experience God\u2019s favor today please drop a message to connect with god.**\n\n# 3.\u00a02 Corinthians 12:9\n\n\u201cMy grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\u201d\n\nThis verse, spoken by Jesus to the Apostle Paul, highlights the paradox of strength found in our weakness. It is a poignant reminder that our limitations can bring us closer to God. When we recognize our vulnerabilities and seek His grace, we are more open to receiving His power. This divine connection reveals that our struggles are not in vain; they serve a purpose, allowing God\u2019s strength to shine through us during our most challenging moments.\n\n# 4.\u00a0Psalm 46:1-2\n\n\u201cGod is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.\u201d\n\nThe Psalmist beautifully expresses the essence of finding strength in God. This passage reassures us that during turbulent times, God is a constant source of support. The divine connection described here acts as a sanctuary, enveloping us in peace and courage even when the world around us feels chaotic. Recognizing God as our refuge empowers us to confront fear head-on.\n\n# 5.\u00a0Ephesians 6:10\n\n\u201cFinally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.\u201d\n\nThis verse offers a simple yet profound instruction. It encourages believers to find strength not in their own might, but in the mighty power of the Lord. This call to action emphasizes the importance of maintaining a close connection with God, inviting His power into our lives. Here, strength is portrayed as a divine gift, readily available to those who seek it.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIncorporating these Bible verses into our daily lives fosters resilience and fortitude, especially when faced with challenges. Each verse serves as a reminder that true strength is more than just personal resolve; it is intertwined with our relationship with the divine. By nurturing our faith and maintaining a connection to God, we open our hearts to receive the strength needed to navigate life\u2019s storms. In moments of weakness, let us remember that through Him, we can accomplish all things, and our spirit can soar.\n\n**Don\u2019t miss your chance to experience God\u2019s favor today please drop a message to connect with god.**"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Abigail (2024) is a sequel to Let Me In (2010)", "content": "So, after watching Abigail (2024), I want to believe that this movie is a direct continuation of Let Me In (2010).  There\u2019s a recurring theme between the two films of characters who wear different identities, hiding their true selves.  I want to explore this theme and how it connects Owen from Let Me In to the character of Kristof Lazar, who we see in Abigail. Fair warning: it requires suspending a bit of disbelief, but stay with me.\n\nI think there is a combined story about why we hide our true identities and how it changes us.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s Abigail herself: a centuries-old vampire forever trapped in the appearance of a twelve-year-old.  She embodies this concept, but her caretakers and others around her seem to mirror it in their own ways too.  Take the old man at the beginning of Let Me In, who pretends to be her father.  He\u2019s worn down, weary, still hopelessly in love with Abigail.  Yet, when he goes out to kill for her, he covers himself with a thick black plastic mask.  It\u2019s like he\u2019s forcing himself into this facade of strength, trying to be someone he\u2019s not\u2014an image of power for Abigail, even as his actual weakness frustrates her.  He eventually melts his own face off when he gets caught.\n\nThen we have Owen, a neglected and bullied kid, literally putting on a mask when we first see him to fantasize about taking revenge, brandishing a knife and emasculating the bullies in his mind.  But Let Me In slowly reveals a shift in him.  He starts to assert an identity that isn\u2019t hidden behind a mask or multiple layers of clothes.  He demonstrates a strength and ruthlessness that could ultimately lead him to becoming Kristof.  Owen, the weak child, becomes the discarded mask of Kristof Lazar, the psychopath that was always there.\n\nIn Abigail, Ana (aka Joey) is yet another example.  Forced into the criminal world by her morphine addiction, she\u2019s given the alias \u201cJoey\" at the start of Abigail, almost like a criminal mask she\u2019s forced to wear.  She carries this weight of shame, hiding behind her \u201cJoey\u201d identity until Abigail rips it away, sending Ana on a path to reclaim identity as a mother by the film\u2019s end.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Adam (aka Frank), a character who wants to be seen as an authority\u2014a cop, an experienced criminal, and later, even as a vampire.  Lambert gives him the alias \u201cFrank,\u201d the de facto leader of the Ratpack.  He presents himself as in control, but it\u2019s clear he\u2019s anything but.  When it seems like he\u2019s won and is about to kill Abigail, we find out that she\u2019s the one in power, showing him just how little control he actually has.  She even tells him that \u201cit takes a long time\u201d to master his newfound powers, exposing his act for what it is.\n\nThe Big Hurdle: Owen as \u201cFather\u201d\n\nOne of the trickiest parts of this theory is that Kristof, by Abigail (2024), is an older, more powerful vampire than Abigail.  Abigail states that he turned her into a vampire, they played with the idea of having Kristof be an alias of Dracula, having Kristof declare that he killed Dracula 200 years ago.  Much of this I can write off as non-cannon, since it wasn\u2019t filmed, but, as I\u2019ll discuss later, I think Kristof\u2019s line can easily be explained if he is only 51 years old.  \n\nI\u2019ll also note here that my understanding is that Abby was about 250 years old in 1983 and Abigail is about 300 years old in 2024.\n \nIf Kristof really were her father, that would leave Owen out of the picture entirely.  But I\u2019d argue that Kristof is Owen\u2014only he\u2019s evolved and, honestly, broken by the end.  If we assume that Kristof\u2019s \u201cfather\" act is an act or dissociative identity that is crafted to distance himself from his past as a weakling or her teenage \u201cboyfriend,\u201d the pieces start fitting together.\n\nLet\u2019s Start with Owen\u2019s Transformation.\n\nAt the end of Let Me In, we have 12-year-old Owen who\u2019s now run away with his vampire \u201cgirlfriend\u201d Abby, who\u2019s agreed to \u201cgo steady\u201d with him.  By this point, he\u2019s already crossed a serious line\u2014he\u2019s helped Abby with multiple murders, including the killing of a police detective who might have represented a father figure to him.  (Fun side note: Elias Koteas also voiced Owen\u2019s dad, possibly hinting that Owen\u2019s relationship with this \u201cprotector\u201d role is deeply fractured.)\n\nFrom the start, Owen is desperate for strength.  He fantasized about overpowering his bullies, even wielding a knife and staring himself down in the mirror.  He takes an interest in self-defense in response to Abby telling him he must fightpack, so I imagine that he\u2019d keep building his strength to protect Abby and, possibly more importantly, himself.  Now that he\u2019s living on society\u2019s fringes, Owen\u2019s adaptation to a life of violence only becomes easier and his reliance on aliases becomes natural.  And here\u2019s where I think things get interesting.\n\nImagine the backdrop: it\u2019s the 1980s, and America\u2019s inner cities are battling the crack epidemic, federal authorities are starting to make inroads into established organized crime, while the Cold War spills over into proxy wars in Central and South America.  Owen would likely find himself getting pulled into this criminal underworld, whether out of necessity or fascination with violence.  I\u2019d say that by his late teens, Owen\u2019s involvement has probably extended into the international drug trade, smuggling, and all the chaos of the Reagan-era drug wars.  Abby might find herself bewildered by these rapid cultural and economic shifts, still adjusting to a world of globalization and technology.\n\nIt might be this time that the assassin Valdez first appears.  Perhaps one of Owen\u2019s aliases.  Abby would not be happy with the increased risk that Owen\u2019s criminal ventures bring, but perhaps she loves the thrill partaking in a hunt, perhaps she cared enough to brutally murder several Sandinistas when he got in over his head instead of abandoning him.  Either way, Owen is an active participant in the most violent criminal organizations by his late teens.\n\nAbby\u2019s acceptance of Owen\u2019s descent into violence, I\u2019d argue, isn\u2019t out of indifference.  For the first time, she\u2019s partnered with a caretaker who\u2019s also a psychopath\u2014a caretaker who provides for her better than anyone ever has.  But, of course, Abby\u2019s M.O. is to subtly nudge these boys from a \u201cboyfriend\u201d to a more familial role, like a brother or father figure.  With Owen, though, she may have underestimated the extent to which he is willing to push or change himself.\n\nAs the Cold War ends, Owen (now in his 20s) has experienced enough brutalizing violence to start detaching from his old self.  The name \u201cKristof Lazar\u201d might just be one of several identities that he adopted during this time.  As he uses his Owen identity less and less that identity becomes associated with weakness, shame, femininity and everything that he hated about himself.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the irony: Abby\u2019s very efforts to push Owen into the role of pretend father backfires.  The identity of Owen is so hurt by this implicit rejection and so ill suited as a father figure that Kristof becomes an unrestrained, dominant identity who dismisses everything soft, weak, and vulnerable about Owen.  Abby, meanwhile, reminds him of his old self\u2014innocent, lonely, vulnerable, dependent, and emasculated.  This creates a dichotomy in Kristof, with him both wanting to protect Abby, yet seeing her as a symbol of everything he hates.\n\nAbby's persona of weakness, used so often to create sympathy or lure victims into a false sense of security only anger Kristof.  Their interactions become intense battles of wills, with him only responding to her angry; animalistic vampire voice or only showing affection as gestures of appreciation for her killing their enemies.  It\u2019s even possible that Abby takes on the name \u201cAbigail\u201d to reinforce a sense of strength, mirroring Kristof\u2019s self-perception of  strength to preserve as much of the power dynamic as she could. (Apparently Alisha Weir called the frightened, kidnapped child version of her character \u201cAbby,\" and the alpha predator \u201cAbigail,\" approaching the character as two entirely separate people)\n\nHere\u2019s where I think Owen starts a complete dissociation.  Kristof becomes his \u201cstrong,\u201d brutal persona, a patriarchal figure who has always existed and is totally separate from \u201cOwen.\u201d  Meanwhile, Abby moves along, primarily engaging this new identity while watching the young boy she used to control transform into a mercenary and criminal powerhouse across Eastern Europe, Central Africa, and beyond.\n\nBy the 2000s, the Kristof persona dominates, and he\u2019s crafted an empire that operates with ruthless efficiency.  Abby, though frustrated with the changing dynamic and her reduced influence, may accept this darker version of her protector because he\u2019s giving her something she\u2019s never had before\u2014absolute freedom.  The Lazar criminal empire covers for Abby as she occasionally hunts for sport, her messes neatly cleaned up by Kristof\u2019s lackeys.  This \u201cfreedom\u201d comes at a cost, though: Kristof\u2019s total dismissal of everything he sees as vulnerable, weak, and feminine including the incredibly powerful and dangerous vampire..\n\nBy the 2010s, Owen is all but buried.  The Kristof persona is his true identity, existing in a violent patriarchal role.  For him, Abigail\u2019s strength and brutality are no longer impressive\u2014they\u2019re useful assets.\n\nAnd Abigail?  She\u2019s finally lost her hold over Kristof, the lines of manipulation long blurred and overwritten by his descent into complete ruthlessness and their shared recreational violence.  The power balance has shifted.  Whether for strategic reasons or nostalgia, Abigail decides to turn Kristof into a vampire in the 2010s.\n\nKristof, now a vampire, is an inversion of Abigail's past caretaker.  The crucial difference between Kristof and her earlier servants is that he\u2019s created his own empire, and it\u2019s in his image, not Abby\u2019s.  She may now look at him as a powerful, even terrifying partner, all while the Owen in him lingers as a painful reminder of a lost identity.  Abigail\u2019s contributions to the rise of the Lazar criminal empire are completely overshadowed by Kristof\u2019s need for power and control.\n\nIn Abigail, we see another attempt by Abigail to gain a new protector, one who she can  control.  She can no longer rely on lonely misfits to grow up and care for her.  She\u2019s enjoyed the freedom to hunt and the thrill of adventure with Kristof, yet she accidentally made a rival to her power.  She needs someone she can control and groom to take Kristof\u2019s place, either as head of the criminal underworld or maybe just as a companion who will be there for her.\n\nLambert is a middleman in the Lazar organic and she turns him into a vampire in 2022.  Perhaps she thought she would make Kristof jealous or be able to groom Lambert into a more suitable companion and servant.  We will juxtapose the two vampires Abigail created later.\n\nAbigail\u2019s cycle of manipulation continues in Abigail.  This time, it\u2019s characters like Ana/Joey and Adam/Frank who get tangled in Abigail\u2019s web.  Ana, in a way, mirrors Owen\u2014struggling with her identity and trying to reclaim her true self.  Adam\u2019s character might represent a twisted echo of Kristof, becoming a vampire but lacking the self-control or depth to manage it.\n\nAt the start of Abigail we see that Abigail is not in hiding like she was in Let Me In.  It is all the other characters who are hiding in the beginning.  After Abigail is captured she begins her manipulation with Joey (Ana) yet the connection between Joey and Abigail was real, despite Abigail's actions and stories being an act.  Joey is perhaps the first person who genuinely cared for Abigail in a long while.  This mutual vulnerability allowed Abigail's defenses to come down, creating a genuine bond.\n\nWhat's interesting is how Ana's experience with Abigail mirrors Owen's early relationship with Abby but diverges in crucial ways. While Owen chooses Abby over his family which will inevitably lead down a dark path, Ana finds redemption by choosing to reconnect with her son. Her genuine connection with Abigail leads to both characters revealing parts of their true selves and Abigail choosing to spare Ana.\n\nThis suggests that, unlike with Owen, Abigail allows herself to form a genuine bond without relying on manipulation.  It could be a sign of her growth or perhaps a moment of vulnerability she hasn't experienced since her early days with Owen when she allowed him to take dangerous actions she would never have approved of with earlier servants..\n\nAna is the one who exposes the true nature of her companions early in the movie by seeing through the bravado.  Later, when Abigail is captured she takes it a step further and reveals that she is intimately familiar with each character\u2019s history, yet she chooses to maintain the \u201cJoey\u201d identity in late interactions with Ana.\n\nAt the end we have several vampires to consider.  I will treat Owen and Kristof as one person, because they are for this theory, and Lambert and Adam as one person, for thematic reasons.\n\nRelationship with Owen/Kristoff:\n\nAbigail meets Owen when he's a vulnerable, bullied child. She presents herself as a lonely girl, fostering a deep emotional bond.  Owen is drawn to her, and she manipulates his need for connection to secure his assistance in acquiring blood.  As Owen grows older, he becomes more violent and entrenched in criminal activities, eventually adopting the Kristof Lazar persona.  Abigail's attempt to mold him into a father figure backfires as Kristof becomes a ruthless crime lord who despises vulnerability\u2014qualities he associates with both his former self and Abigail\u2019s \u201cAbby\u201d persona.\n\nTheir relationship shifts from one of manipulator and manipulated to adversaries in a complex power struggle.  Kristof's disdain for weakness leads him to clash with Abigail as he seeks to exert control over his life, yet there's an underlying bond that neither can fully sever.  Abigail's decision to turn Kristof into a vampire is a desperate attempt to regain influence or reconnect with the Owen she once knew.  However, it only amplifies Kristof's power and autonomy, further destabilizing their relationship.  Their relationship becomes a twisted amalgamation of resentment, dependency, and unspoken affection.  They are locked in a conflict where they no longer need each other yet cannot completely escape the lingering habits of their old codependent behaviors.\n\nThe ultimate twist is that Kristof may still feel a need to be needed by Abigail.  When he says, \u201cI came when you needed me,\u201d it\u2019s definitely not about her fight with Adam.\n\nRelationship with Lambert and Adam:\n\nSeeking to fill the void left by Kristof's detachment, Abigail turns Lambert into a vampire in 2022.  She aims to create a loyal servant who can be controlled, perhaps believing she can avoid the mistakes made with Owen/Kristof.  Lambert, however, resents being subservient to \u201ca little girl and her daddy.\u201d  He plots to overthrow them, revealing that Abigail's manipulation has once again led to unintended consequences.  Adam (Frank), turned by Lambert, embodies unchecked ambition and a thirst for power without understanding its true nature.\n\nUnlike with Owen, there is no deep emotional bond between Abigail and Lambert or Adam.  Their relationships are transactional, lacking the history and complexity that existed with Owen/Kristof.  Both Lambert and Adam's betrayals highlight the pitfalls of Abigail's manipulative strategies.  Her attempts to control powerful individuals without genuine connection result in direct threats to her safety and empire.\n\nRelationship with Ana:\n\nAbigail initially manipulates Ana by posing as a helpless kidnapping victim.  However, Ana's ability to see through facades allows her to connect with Abigail on a deeper level.  As the story progresses, both characters reveal truths about themselves.  Ana shares her struggles with addiction and motherhood, while Abigail shows glimpses of her true self beyond the manipulative exterior.\n\nUnlike Owen or Lambert, Ana chooses a path of redemption, seeking to reconnect with her son and rejecting the criminal life.  Abigail, recognizing the sincerity in Ana, chooses to spare her, breaking her usual pattern of manipulation leading to destruction.  Their relationship stands in contrast to Abigail's other interactions.  It is built on genuine understanding rather than manipulation, offering a glimmer of hope for both characters to find some semblance of peace.\n\nAbigail's relationship with Owen/Kristof is deeply rooted but marred by manipulation and power struggles.  With Lambert and Adam, the lack of emotional connection leads to outright betrayal.  Ana represents a different path, where genuine connection allows for mutual growth.  Abigail's attempts to control Owen and Lambert through manipulation and empowerment result in unintended and dangerous outcomes.  In contrast, her openness with Ana leads to a more positive resolution.\n\nOwen/Kristof's identity crisis affects his relationship with Abigail, as he grapples with his past and present selves.  Lambert and Adam's lack of depth prevents them from understanding the complexities of power.  Ana's self-awareness enables her to break free from her destructive patterns.\n\nThe potential reconciliation between Abigail and Kristof at the end of Abigail carries significant implications for both characters and the overarching themes of identity, power, and redemption.  When Kristof says, \u201cI came when you needed me,\u201d it signals a recognition of their enduring connection despite years of conflict.  This line harks back to their initial relationship, suggesting that beneath the layers of resentment, there's still a bond.\n\nBoth Abigail and Kristof have worn masks\u2014literal and metaphorical\u2014to protect themselves.  Their reconciliation might represent a willingness to lower these defenses and confront their true selves.  Abigail's statement that \u201c[Ana] was here when you weren't\" exposes her feelings of abandonment and need.  Kristof's protective response suggests he still cares, allowing space for genuine emotion.\n\nI like to think that Abigail and Kristof turn a page in their relationship, embracing who the other has become.  Abigail accepts that Kristof can be a partner instead of a servant or rival Kristof accepting that Abigail, though no longer needing protection the same way she used to, still needs companionship, and he does.\n\nKristof's claim to have lived \u201ccountless years\" might be him telling Abigail that he'll accept the role of \u201cfather\" and pretend to be more powerful than her.\n\nOr he's so crazy he believes it.\n\nOr he really is an ancient vampire and these characters aren't the same."}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Prolotherapy Doctors Near Me: Questions to Ask Before Choosing Your Provider", "content": "https://preview.redd.it/nrgbid4lnlxd1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b0682151ef23f36ac68302a9b490604e210a29b\n\nWhen considering a medical treatment like prolotherapy, finding the right doctor can make all the difference. Prolotherapy is an increasingly popular regenerative injection therapy that can effectively help with chronic pain and musculoskeletal issues. But not every provider is the same, and choosing a well-qualified doctor is key to receiving the best possible care. In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about prolotherapy, including crucial questions to ask when selecting a provider.\n\n# Understanding Prolotherapy\n\nProlotherapy, short for \"proliferative therapy,\" is a non-surgical treatment aimed at promoting healing of damaged ligaments, tendons, and joints. It involves injecting a solution, typically dextrose or saline, directly into the affected area to trigger the body's natural healing processes. This promotes tissue growth and strengthens weakened areas, ultimately leading to pain reduction and improved function.\n\nProlotherapy can be beneficial for a range of conditions, including arthritis, ligament tears, chronic joint pain, and tendon injuries. It is particularly appealing because of its non-invasive nature, offering a promising alternative for those looking to avoid surgery or long-term dependence on pain medication. However, the success of the treatment largely depends on the provider's skill and experience, making it crucial to select the right doctor.\n\n# Questions to Ask When Considering a Prolotherapy Provider\n\nChoosing the best prolotherapy doctor for your needs can feel like a daunting task. To help you navigate this process, here are some important questions to ask before committing to any particular provider:\n\n# 1. What Are Your Qualifications?\n\nBefore receiving prolotherapy, it\u2019s essential to verify your doctor\u2019s qualifications. Look for a provider who is properly trained in prolotherapy techniques and has experience performing the procedure. Medical doctors, osteopathic physicians, and some chiropractors can provide prolotherapy, but their background in regenerative medicine varies. Asking about their certifications, education, and any specialized training in prolotherapy will help you assess their qualifications.\n\n# 2. How Much Experience Do You Have with Prolotherapy?\n\nExperience matters when it comes to prolotherapy. Ask your provider how long they have been performing prolotherapy and how many treatments they have done. A seasoned prolotherapy specialist is likely to have treated a wide range of conditions and developed a high level of precision when injecting the affected areas. A provider with extensive experience is also more likely to achieve positive outcomes with fewer complications.\n\n# 3. What Conditions Do You Commonly Treat?\n\nProlotherapy can be effective for a wide range of conditions, from sports injuries to degenerative joint diseases. Not every provider will be equally experienced in treating all conditions, though. If you are dealing with a specific problem, such as chronic knee pain or a rotator cuff injury, make sure to ask the doctor whether they have successfully treated similar cases. A provider with a strong track record in treating your specific condition is more likely to offer the best results.\n\n# 4. What Should I Expect During and After the Procedure?\n\nA good prolotherapy doctor will be transparent about what to expect before, during, and after the procedure. During your consultation, ask about the treatment plan, including the expected number of injections, potential side effects, and the estimated duration of each session. [Prolotherapy doctors near me](https://www.ultimatemedgroup.com/prolotherapy) often emphasize the importance of follow-up visits and complementary treatments, such as physical therapy, to optimize results. Make sure to discuss the recovery process and any recommended activity restrictions so that you are prepared for what lies ahead.\n\n# 5. How Do You Ensure Safety During Prolotherapy?\n\nSafety should be a top priority when undergoing any medical procedure, including prolotherapy. Ask your provider what measures they take to minimize risk and ensure the highest level of safety. This may include discussing sterilization practices, the use of imaging guidance (such as ultrasound) to accurately deliver the injections, and an overall focus on minimizing discomfort. Experienced providers should also be forthcoming about possible side effects and complications, and how they handle any unexpected issues.\n\n# 6. Can You Provide References or Patient Testimonials?\n\nHearing from past patients can give you valuable insights into the doctor's expertise and the overall patient experience. Reputable prolotherapy doctors often have patient testimonials or references available upon request. While these anecdotes are not a substitute for medical research, they can provide a glimpse into the quality of care you can expect. If possible, seek reviews from patients with conditions similar to yours, as this may provide more relevant information.\n\n# 7. How Do You Personalize Treatment Plans?\n\nEvery patient is unique, and the success of prolotherapy often depends on a customized approach. Ask your doctor how they create individualized treatment plans based on each patient\u2019s specific condition, pain levels, and medical history. A provider who takes the time to evaluate your unique needs and create a tailored treatment plan is more likely to provide a successful outcome.\n\n# 8. What Is the Estimated Cost, and Is Prolotherapy Covered by Insurance?\n\nCost is often a significant factor for many patients considering prolotherapy. Since prolotherapy is sometimes considered an alternative treatment, it may not be covered by insurance. Ask about the overall cost of treatment, including the number of sessions likely required and any other associated fees. Many doctors offer payment plans or financing options, so make sure to inquire about all available options to make treatment more affordable.\n\n# 9. Do You Offer Complementary Treatments?\n\nProlotherapy may be more effective when used in combination with other therapies, such as physical therapy, chiropractic care, or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections. Ask if your prolotherapy provider offers these complementary treatments or can refer you to another specialist. Combining therapies can often lead to faster and more effective results, especially for more severe or chronic conditions.\n\n# 10. What Is Your Success Rate?\n\nThough it may be difficult for any doctor to guarantee specific results, an experienced prolotherapy provider should be able to give you a general idea of their success rates. Ask about the percentage of patients who experience significant improvement after treatment and what factors may affect the outcome. Keep in mind that prolotherapy success often depends on factors such as the patient\u2019s overall health, the severity of the injury, and adherence to post-treatment care.\n\n# Important Factors to Consider Beyond the Questions\n\nAside from asking questions, there are other factors to consider when selecting a prolotherapy doctor. A comfortable and trusting relationship with your provider is vital. Since prolotherapy often requires multiple sessions over several months, choosing a doctor who listens to your concerns and makes you feel at ease can greatly enhance your treatment experience.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s wise to do your research before your initial consultation. Check the doctor\u2019s credentials online, read reviews, and see if they have any published articles or resources that reflect their expertise. Your treatment journey will be smoother if you have confidence in your doctor and their ability to provide quality care.\n\nAnother important consideration is the location of the provider's office. Since prolotherapy often involves a series of injections over multiple visits, convenience matters. Choosing a prolotherapy doctor near your home or workplace can save you time and make it easier to adhere to your treatment schedule.\n\n# The Benefits of Prolotherapy\n\nProlotherapy has become a preferred option for those looking to avoid surgery or reduce their reliance on prescription medications. This regenerative treatment offers several advantages that make it a popular choice for patients with chronic pain.\n\n# 1. Natural Healing\n\nOne of the primary benefits of prolotherapy is that it uses the body\u2019s own healing mechanisms to repair damaged tissues. The injected solution stimulates the production of collagen, which is a key component in strengthening ligaments and tendons. Unlike surgery, which often involves significant downtime and rehabilitation, prolotherapy promotes natural healing without altering the body's structure.\n\n# 2. Non-Invasive Procedure\n\nProlotherapy is a minimally invasive procedure that requires no incisions or anesthesia. This makes it an ideal option for those who are hesitant about surgery or have medical conditions that increase the risks associated with surgical procedures. The lack of surgical intervention also means that there is little to no downtime required after the treatment, allowing patients to return to their daily activities sooner.\n\n# 3. Improved Joint Stability\n\nLigament laxity or weakness is a common cause of joint instability, leading to pain and limited mobility. Prolotherapy targets the root cause by strengthening these weakened ligaments, resulting in improved joint stability. This can be particularly helpful for those suffering from conditions like hypermobility or joint degeneration, where strengthening the surrounding tissues can significantly reduce symptoms.\n\n# 4. Pain Reduction\n\nChronic pain is often the result of weakened ligaments and tendons, which leads to increased strain on the joints. Prolotherapy directly addresses the underlying cause of pain by promoting tissue repair and strengthening the affected areas. Many patients report a significant reduction in pain levels after completing their prolotherapy treatment plan, allowing them to resume activities they previously avoided.\n\n# 5. Long-Term Results\n\nUnlike pain medications, which offer temporary relief, prolotherapy aims to provide long-term improvement by treating the source of the problem. While it may take several weeks or months to see full results, the effects of prolotherapy can be lasting, especially when combined with other treatments or lifestyle changes like exercise and proper nutrition. Because of this long-term impact, prolotherapy can be an excellent investment in your overall health and mobility.\n\n# What to Expect During Prolotherapy Treatment\n\nUnderstanding the prolotherapy process can help ease any anxieties you may have about undergoing treatment. Here's what you can typically expect before, during, and after the procedure.\n\n# 1. Initial Consultation\n\nYour first appointment with a prolotherapy provider will involve a thorough assessment of your condition, including a discussion of your medical history, symptoms, and treatment goals. The doctor may also perform a physical examination and review imaging studies, such as X-rays or MRIs, to understand the underlying issues better.\n\n# 2. Treatment Plan\n\nBased on the evaluation, your doctor will develop a customized treatment plan that may include a series of prolotherapy injections. The number of sessions needed will vary depending on the severity of your condition and how well your body responds to treatment. Most patients require between three to six sessions, spaced several weeks apart.\n\n# 3. Injection Procedure\n\nDuring each prolotherapy session, your doctor will use a fine needle to inject the solution directly into the injured area. The injections are typically well-tolerated, but you may experience some discomfort during the procedure. Your doctor may use a local anesthetic to minimize pain.\n\n# 4. Post-Treatment Recovery\n\nAfter the injections, you may experience mild soreness or swelling in the treated area, which is normal and indicates that the body's healing process has begun. The discomfort usually subsides within a few days. It is important to follow any post-treatment instructions provided by your doctor, which may include avoiding strenuous activities for a short period.\n\nMost patients can resume normal daily activities immediately after the procedure, although you may need to modify your physical activity level for a few days. To maximize the effectiveness of prolotherapy, your provider may recommend complementary therapies, such as physical therapy or specific exercises to strengthen the treated area.\n\n# Finding Prolotherapy Doctors Near Me: Final Thoughts\n\nSelecting the right prolotherapy doctor can make a significant difference in the outcome of your treatment. By asking the right questions and considering important factors such as experience, qualifications, and patient reviews, you can make an informed decision that sets you on the path to successful healing.\n\nProlotherapy is a promising treatment for those dealing with chronic pain, joint instability, or ligament injuries, and choosing a skilled provider is crucial to achieving the best results. Take the time to research potential doctors, schedule consultations, and evaluate your comfort level with each provider. A good prolotherapy doctor will not only have the necessary skills but also take the time to listen to your concerns, provide clear answers, and create a treatment plan that aligns with your individual needs.\n\nRemember that prolotherapy is just one part of a holistic approach to health and pain management. A healthy lifestyle, proper diet, regular exercise, and stress management can all contribute to better outcomes and overall well-being. Collaborating with a prolotherapy doctor who understands the importance of a comprehensive approach to health can significantly enhance your treatment results and help you regain control of your life.\n\nWhether you are dealing with sports injuries, arthritis, or chronic joint pain, prolotherapy offers an effective and natural solution that can restore function, reduce pain, and improve your quality of life. By investing in the right prolotherapy provider, you are investing in a future of better health and mobility."}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "SEO (Wolfpack vs Full View Vs Spectora Vs HG)", "content": "For anyone out there who has used any of these services what were your results?

It's a time to remember those who have suffered, to offer support to those who are still in the fight, and to shine a light on the devastating realities of this issue. As a Filipino author, I've always been drawn to stories of resilience, of people who overcome adversity and find beauty in the face of pain.  Jane's story, a survivor of domestic violence who shared her story with KING 5's Facing Race team, embodies this spirit of resilience. \n\nJane's story is a powerful reminder of the insidious nature of domestic violence. She spoke about the fear, the isolation, and the constant threat of violence that she endured for seven years.  These words resonated deeply with me.  I couldn't help but think about the friends and family members who may be suffering in silence, carrying a burden that is too heavy to bear alone.  \n\nMy own father, Ermenildo Castro, was a man who believed in strength and self-reliance. He was a hard worker, a loving husband, and a devoted father. But his own experiences with violence, both physical and emotional, left a mark on him that was impossible to ignore.  It was a dark cloud that followed him throughout his life, and it impacted the relationships he had with everyone around him.  I remember how his anger could erupt unexpectedly, leaving a chilling silence in its wake.  It wasn't until I was much older that I realized the root of his anger stemmed from his own experiences with violence.  I saw the shadow of this pain cloud his life, and I felt the ripples of its impact on our family.  \n\nI\u2019ve always tried to see the best in people, but I've seen the shadow of domestic violence cast over the lives of people I know. It's a problem that affects everyone, regardless of race, religion, gender, or socioeconomic status.  \n\nJane's story reminds us that the fight against domestic violence is not just about ending physical abuse. It's also about ending the shame and stigma that often keep victims silent.  It took immense courage for her to speak out about her experiences and to share her vulnerability. She chose to use her story to give others courage, and I hope her message resonates with those who may be facing a similar situation.  \n\nJane\u2019s story is a testament to the strength and resilience of the human spirit.  She found the courage to leave her abuser and start a new chapter in her life, a chapter filled with hope and possibility.  \n\nIn my own journey as an author, I've found strength in sharing my own story. It's been a journey filled with both joy and pain, but it's also been a journey of growth and transformation.  I believe that by sharing our stories, we can create a more compassionate and understanding world, a world where those who have been hurt can find healing and hope. \n\nDomestic violence is an issue that requires the commitment of the entire community.  I believe that by working together, we can create a society where everyone feels safe, supported, and empowered.  We can all be agents of change. We can all choose to be allies in the fight against domestic violence.  Let\u2019s all work together to end domestic violence and create a world where everyone feels safe and empowered.

But in many parts of the world, the promise of resource wealth has been hijacked by corruption and power politics, transforming the mantra of \"drill, baby, drill\" into a rallying cry for the exploitation of national treasures. Instead of empowering nations, this approach too often becomes a tool for a privileged few to amass staggering wealth, leaving everyday citizens impoverished and their countries environmentally devastated.\n\n# The Resource Curse: A National Dilemma\n\nAt the heart of the issue lies a paradox often called the \"resource curse.\" Countries with an abundance of natural resources\u2014particularly oil, gas, and minerals\u2014tend to experience less economic growth and worse development outcomes than nations with fewer resources. This paradox can often be traced to weak governance, the lack of oversight, and policies that fail to prioritize national welfare. In many instances, the profits from these resources end up in the pockets of political elites, while the broader population sees little improvement in infrastructure, education, or healthcare.\n\n# Power and Corruption: A Vicious Cycle\n\nOnce leaders discover the enormous revenue potential of their nation\u2019s resources, a vicious cycle often ensues. In many resource-rich countries, leaders either assume absolute control over resource extraction or forge close alliances with multinational corporations. These corporations, while often bringing technical expertise, may also become entangled in local corruption. Bribes, kickbacks, and favorable contracts are frequently exchanged, enabling politicians to secure vast sums while corporations secure access to profitable assets.\n\nSuch arrangements make oversight nearly impossible. Public scrutiny is rare because the political system itself is often designed to silence critics. Investigative journalists and activists who call attention to corruption are frequently threatened, jailed, or, in extreme cases, killed. In many countries, this environment of fear and repression ensures that those benefiting from corruption remain protected from accountability.\n\n# Environmental Degradation: The Hidden Cost\n\nThe environmental cost of unchecked resource extraction is immense. Forests are razed, rivers polluted, and air quality worsened, but because the citizens often lack a voice, these costs are ignored. Take, for instance, the oil-rich regions of the Amazon rainforest. Corporations granted drilling permits by governments often operate with minimal environmental regulation, leading to irreversible ecosystem damage. Indigenous and local communities suffer the consequences, and nations lose invaluable natural heritage, but the damage goes largely unaccounted for.\n\n# Case Studies: Nigeria, Venezuela, and Russia\n\n**Nigeria**\n\nNigeria, one of the world's top oil producers, presents a striking example of how resource wealth can foster inequality. The Nigerian government\u2019s alliances with foreign oil companies have fueled a culture of corruption that prevents the revenues from benefiting the country\u2019s population. In the oil-rich Niger Delta, local communities bear the brunt of pollution and social upheaval, with few tangible benefits to show for the billions of dollars\u2019 worth of oil extracted from their land.\n\n**Venezuela**\n\nVenezuela\u2019s experience reveals the risks of over-reliance on a single resource and the political power it can wield. With one of the largest oil reserves in the world, Venezuela saw significant economic growth during periods of high oil prices. However, when oil prices plummeted, a lack of economic diversification and rampant corruption led to an economic crisis. Citizens were left without adequate access to food, medicine, or public services, despite the country\u2019s immense resource wealth.\n\n**Russia**\n\nIn Russia, the wealth generated from oil and gas has empowered an elite class of oligarchs closely tied to political leadership. While energy revenues contribute significantly to Russia\u2019s GDP, they are often used to entrench political power and maintain the dominance of an elite minority. Meanwhile, many Russians live below the poverty line, with little opportunity to benefit from the nation's natural resources.\n\n# What Can Be Done? Reforms and Recommendations\n\nAddressing resource-related corruption requires fundamental changes to national and international systems. Here are a few strategies to curb the siphoning of national wealth:\n\n1. **Transparency and Accountability**: Resource extraction contracts, revenues, and expenditures should be made public, enabling citizens and watchdog groups to scrutinize how national wealth is used.\n2. **Independent Regulatory Bodies**: To prevent political influence over resource management, independent regulatory agencies with oversight powers should be established. These agencies must be given the authority to enforce environmental and ethical standards.\n3. **Revenue Redistribution**: Developing policies that distribute resource revenues directly to citizens or invest in public infrastructure can help ensure that resource wealth benefits all.\n4. **Environmental Safeguards**: Enforcing strict environmental standards and monitoring procedures for resource extraction is critical to protect ecosystems and local communities.\n5. **International Support and Sanctions**: International bodies and coalitions can play a crucial role by enforcing sanctions against regimes that engage in resource-related corruption and by providing support for reforms.\n\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Drill, baby, drill\" remains a rallying cry in global energy markets, but for too many nations, it has also come to symbolize unchecked greed and environmental degradation. Leaders who exploit their country's natural resources for personal gain not only rob their citizens of potential prosperity but also leave lasting damage to their nations\u2019 social and ecological fabric. By holding leaders accountable and demanding transparency, the world can begin to turn the tide on this cycle of exploitation, ensuring that natural resources fulfill their potential as a blessing, rather than a curse."}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Meta Develops AI Search Engine To Lessen Reliance on Google, Microsoft ", "content": ""}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Online DSE Assessment", "content": "**DSE (Display Screen Equipment) \u2013 Ensure a Healthy Workstation Setup**\n\nDisplay Screen Equipment (DSE) refers to devices with visual display screens used in workplaces, such as computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

Fortunately, prolotherapy has emerged as a promising solution for individuals seeking long-lasting pain relief without surgery or heavy reliance on medications. As an innovative regenerative treatment, prolotherapy encourages the body to repair injured or weakened areas through natural processes, using carefully administered injections to stimulate healing. If you\u2019re considering prolotherapy to address your joint or musculoskeletal pain, you may be wondering how to choose the right prolotherapy specialist in your area. This blog will guide you through the key points to consider when comparing prolotherapy doctors near you for the best pain relief experience.\n\n**What is Prolotherapy and How Does It Work?**\n\nProlotherapy, short for proliferative therapy, involves the injection of a natural irritant solution, often containing substances like dextrose or saline, into the targeted area. These injections stimulate the body's natural healing mechanisms, leading to the repair and regrowth of damaged tissues, particularly tendons, ligaments, and joints. By causing a controlled level of inflammation, prolotherapy prompts the body to send growth factors to the treated region, promoting tissue repair and regeneration. This treatment is ideal for individuals dealing with conditions such as osteoarthritis, chronic joint pain, ligament injuries, or back pain. However, finding the right prolotherapy specialist is crucial to ensure effective results.\n\n**Why Choosing the Right Prolotherapy Doctor Matters**\n\nChoosing the right prolotherapy doctor can make a significant difference in your treatment outcome. Because prolotherapy requires precise injections to achieve optimal results, the experience and skills of the practitioner are of utmost importance. A well-qualified doctor will not only have the right credentials and training but also a strong understanding of musculoskeletal anatomy and an in-depth knowledge of regenerative medicine. Moreover, the technique and approach of the prolotherapy specialist can affect the level of discomfort during treatment and the overall success rate of the therapy. In this blog, we will outline the most important factors to consider when comparing prolotherapy doctors in your area.\n\n**Factors to Consider When Choosing Prolotherapy Specialists**\n\nWhen searching for \"[prolotherapy doctors near me](https://www.ultimatemedgroup.com/prolotherapy),\" there are several key factors that you should evaluate before making your choice. These factors include the doctor's experience, credentials, approach to patient care, and the available treatment options. Let\u2019s take a deeper dive into each of these aspects to help you choose the best prolotherapy specialist.\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Credentials and Training**\n\nProlotherapy is a specialized procedure, so it\u2019s essential that the doctor you choose has received adequate training in regenerative medicine. Look for board-certified physicians who have experience in pain management, orthopedics, sports medicine, or physiatry. These specialties often require a deep understanding of musculoskeletal health and can help ensure that the doctor has the expertise necessary for successful prolotherapy treatments. Additionally, you may want to inquire about any specific certifications or training in prolotherapy, such as courses offered by recognized regenerative medicine institutions.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Experience with Prolotherapy**\n\nExperience matters, especially when it comes to administering injections with precision and accuracy. A prolotherapy specialist with years of hands-on experience will be more capable of locating the exact problem areas and administering injections effectively. Doctors who have successfully treated a wide range of conditions through prolotherapy may also be more confident and efficient, which could improve your experience and results. Don't hesitate to ask prospective doctors how many prolotherapy procedures they have performed and what types of conditions they commonly treat.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Personalized Treatment Plans**\n\nEvery patient is different, and your treatment plan should be tailored to your specific needs. A quality prolotherapy specialist will take the time to assess your medical history, understand your symptoms, and develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses your unique concerns. Some individuals may require multiple rounds of injections to achieve optimal results, while others may benefit from additional treatments, such as physical therapy or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, in conjunction with prolotherapy. A personalized approach ensures that your treatment plan is both effective and aligned with your overall health goals.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Approach to Patient Care**\n\nPatient care goes beyond just providing medical treatment. The right prolotherapy specialist should make you feel comfortable, listen to your concerns, and provide clear communication about the procedure, risks, and expected outcomes. A doctor who takes the time to educate you on the process and sets realistic expectations can alleviate much of the anxiety associated with undergoing a new treatment. You should feel empowered to ask questions and discuss any concerns about your care. Additionally, positive reviews from previous patients can offer insights into a doctor\u2019s approach to patient care.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Office Location and Facilities**\n\nSince prolotherapy often requires multiple visits, the location of the doctor\u2019s office should be convenient for you. Consider specialists who are located within reasonable distance to avoid long commutes, which can add to the stress of dealing with chronic pain. Additionally, a well-equipped and clean facility is essential for safe procedures. Make sure the doctor's office has the necessary tools and equipment for diagnostic evaluation, as well as comfortable facilities to help put you at ease during treatment.\n\n**Benefits of Choosing the Right Prolotherapy Specialist**\n\nThe benefits of finding a skilled and compassionate prolotherapy specialist go beyond pain relief. With the right provider, you can experience significant improvements in mobility, reduced reliance on pain medications, and an overall enhancement in your quality of life. Prolotherapy can offer a natural and minimally invasive approach to healing, without the risks associated with surgery or opioid medications. Whether you\u2019re an athlete looking to get back to your sport, or someone who simply wants to enjoy daily activities without constant pain, prolotherapy can help you achieve those goals.\n\n**Consultation and Questions to Ask**\n\nA consultation is your opportunity to learn more about the doctor, their expertise, and whether they are a good fit for your needs. During the consultation, don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions that will help you assess the doctor\u2019s competence and suitability for your specific condition. Questions such as, \u201cHow many prolotherapy treatments have you performed?\u201d, \u201cWhat is your success rate?\u201d, \u201cDo you offer other regenerative treatments?\u201d, and \u201cHow do you handle pain management during the procedure?\u201d can provide valuable information and help you make an informed decision. You can also ask about potential risks, aftercare instructions, and how many sessions are typically needed to see results.\n\n**Evaluating Patient Reviews and Testimonials**\n\nAnother helpful way to compare prolotherapy specialists is to read patient reviews and testimonials. Reviews can offer insights into the doctor\u2019s approach, the quality of care, and the experiences of other patients. Look for reviews that specifically mention prolotherapy and detail the patient\u2019s outcomes, the professionalism of the staff, and how comfortable they felt during the treatment process. However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that everyone\u2019s experience can vary, so it\u2019s best to use reviews as just one of many factors in your decision-making process.\n\n**The Role of Diagnostic Imaging**\n\nIn some cases, prolotherapy specialists may use diagnostic imaging, such as ultrasound, to help guide the injections and ensure that they are administered to the exact area in need of healing. This technique is called image-guided prolotherapy and can enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of the treatment. If you have a complex injury or chronic condition, choosing a specialist who offers image-guided injections may be particularly beneficial. Ask the doctor whether they use imaging technology during prolotherapy, and if so, how it contributes to their approach.\n\n**Complementary Therapies and Integrative Care**\n\nProlotherapy can be more effective when combined with complementary therapies, such as physical therapy, chiropractic care, or nutritional support. Some prolotherapy specialists take an integrative approach, combining prolotherapy with other regenerative techniques like platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or stem cell therapy. These complementary treatments can further enhance the body\u2019s healing response and improve overall outcomes. Consider whether the doctor you\u2019re evaluating offers an integrative approach and can recommend additional therapies that can support your healing journey.\n\n**Insurance and Costs**\n\nWhile prolotherapy is a promising treatment for chronic pain, it\u2019s important to understand the costs involved, as it may not be covered by insurance. During your consultation, ask about the cost of treatment, how many sessions are typically required, and whether there are any financing options available. Some prolotherapy specialists offer package deals that can help reduce the overall cost, especially if multiple treatments are needed. Understanding the financial aspect of the treatment in advance will allow you to make a decision that aligns with your budget and treatment goals.\n\n**Take Your Time to Make an Informed Choice**\n\nFinding the right prolotherapy specialist is a process that requires research, evaluation, and consultation. It\u2019s worth taking the time to compare different doctors in your area and consider all of the factors we\u2019ve outlined above, such as credentials, experience, personalized care, and patient reviews. Prolotherapy can offer significant relief from chronic pain, but achieving the best results depends on finding a specialist who is experienced, compassionate, and dedicated to your healing.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nChoosing the right prolotherapy specialist is a critical step in your journey to find effective, non-surgical pain relief. By evaluating the doctor's credentials, experience, treatment approach, and level of patient care, you can make an informed decision and take control of your health. Remember that prolotherapy is a partnership between you and your doctor\u2014finding a specialist who is attentive, knowledgeable, and supportive will not only help relieve your pain but also empower you to live a more active and fulfilling life. Whether you\u2019re dealing with a sports injury, chronic back pain, or arthritis, the right prolotherapy specialist can help you achieve long-lasting relief and get back to doing the things you love."}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "[Possible Contest Entry] Third World and Proud Of It! Regional culture in an independent Southeastern Louisiana, with possible prophetic visions from our own timeline.", "content": ""}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "An Open Letter to Anyone Who Is Struggling with Landing Their First Job. ", "content": "DONT GIVE UP, IT IS NOT AS BAD AS YOU THINK!\n\nRecently I came across a post of a user here who is feeling exasperated in their search for their first job. I attempted to post this in a coment for that user, but due to word limits, I could not post this complete letter. Instead I am going to write it here instead. \n\nHello law student.  In an attempt to perhaps give you some context for what you are up against, I am going to provide you some takeaways I have found about the industry. This information is in part adapted from an article on the subject from the Harvard Business Review. Hopefully, armed with this knowledge, the application process will seem less arbitrary and maybe you can better tailor your application and interview to be the most attractive candidate possible. \n\nTo start, perhaps this might be of help to you right now by placing yourself in the shoes of a your potential employer. There are really only four types of law firms: commodity practices, procedural \"mid-market\" firms, gray hair/white shoe firms, and the boutique practice. (See HBR article). Sucessful firms tend to addopt one of these strategies and thus catering your application to them will help you be more sucessful in the application process (as well as more aware of what you are up against). \n\n*Before discussing these firms, just know that much of this is my personal opinion, some of which is backed by experts (but most of it isnt). If my responses seem cynical or biased towards one type of practice or groupe I can assure you that while they were probably cynical, they were not ment to be biased to a particualr firm type. I am just tring to be honest to the reader as to what I think after being someone who has been in the applicant pool many times now and, in some ways, I am still trying to find my own place in the legal profession. That being said, lets jump right in.*\n\n**1) The commodity practice.** To define these terms a bit, a commodity practice is one which solves a client's routine, simple problems repeatedly and efficiently. Its main value proposition is it provides these services at low cost as well as quick and efficient services. Typically, these firms practice, and areas were templates and forms carry the day. For example, firms that do commercial real estate, residential home title disputes (quitclaim) are in this market, and some PI firms are also in this arena. On the criminal side, DUI practices are often marketed as a \"commodity\" in some areas. Some social security/disability practices might also be lumped in to this market. (However, it is important not to confuse the commodity practice with the Boutique practice which also tends to niche down into very specific markets--the main difference being that the boutique practice solves \"difficult\" problems which can be quite spendy whereas the commodity practice solves simple problems in high volume.) \n\nSince these practices live and die on keeping costs down, such firms look to hire associates who are willing to do the maximum amount of (efficient) work for the lowest possible salary. Expertise is not necessary (or even encouraged at some firms in this area) due to the heavy reliance on standardization to promote efficiency. Also, because the market is competitive, these firms are typically forced to hire new associates who have nowhere else to go, are looking for a part-time or semi-temporary job, or are motivated for the \"cause\" that the firm takes up. Often these firms value people who have some of the \"soft skills\" and can work well with others and are receptive to training to achieve maximum efficiency. That being said, these types of firms can sometimes operate like a Ponzi-scheme--netting very significant returns for the one or two equity owners of the firm. (A good argument could be made that firms like Morgan & Morgan are commodity practices and I doubt anyone will dispute that the Morgans are cash poor). While the pay typically bad at these firms, if you are interested in starting your own ~~Ponzi-scheme~~ commodity practice, much can be learned by spending a year or so in one. Not to mention you can copy many of the treasured \"forms\" which will aid you in starting your own firm. \n\n**2) The procedural \"Mid Market\" firm.** Like commodity practices, Mid Markets tend to stick to very regimented scripts, but unlike commodity practices, have the capacity to handle more complex projects with interrelated parts. These firms are often tied to a single geographic area and as such, their clients come from such areas as well. Mid Market firms often aspire to resemble \"white-shoe\" firms and often the only thing which separates the two is how clients 'perceive' the firm (as well as what the clients will pay). A good test to tell if a firm is Mid Market or is a Boutique or white-shoe firm is to determine if the firm is 'fungible' or not as mid-markets rely on territorially as a moat. Speaking of clients, Mid Markets can have an incredibly diverse set of clients ranging from affluent individuals to large companies seeking local counsel. This same diverse set of interests is also reflected in the Mid Market's service offerings which are typically quite extensive. \n\nThe lifeblood of the procedural firm demands that associates have that \"fire-on-the-belly\" spirt of hard work and enterprise. These firms typically struggle to motivate people through money and instead require that associates are \"self-motivated\" to generate massive billable rates. For better or worse, the key to associate positions at these firms is to show that you are not \"dead weight\" and instead will commit to several years of service to make it worthwhile for the firm to train you (your profitability really increases after year 3 or so). The last thing these firms want is for you to join for a year taking a paycheck only to suddenly explore better employment prospects at a competing firm or explore some other lifestyle. A combination of verve, intelligence, professionalism (as well as a lack of other employment options) will carry the day at mid-markets. As such, be sure to show that you have strong roots in the area to show that you won\u2019t leave town before profitability.\n\n **3) Gray hair/white shoe firms.** These are the firms that every law student day-dreams about at least once in their time in law school. These firms are often shrouded in mystery and euphemisms as hundreds of students drool at the mouth to get a chance at joining one of these \"elite\" institutions (as often they pay quite well). Sometimes these firms are referred to as \"Biglaw\" however, this moniker is often more confusing than it is helpful because the size of the firm has nothing to do with its business model. (In addition, some define Biglaw as synonymous with a firm adhering to a particular pay-scale for associates which in reality only rules out the commodity practice). The reality is that these firms have more in common with luxury brands than one might think. The most successful ones have figured out the formula for siphoning money from fortune 500 companies and placing it in their own coffers. At its core, these firms operate by being able to provide clients clarity on an ill-defined issue for which the client (most often a business or Elon musk) has little experience in handling. Like the mid market firm, these firms often handle a bit of everything to provide 'full services' to their client and to prevent them from doing business at other firms. However, unlike the procedural \"mid market\" firm, white shoe firms are able to sell themselves on a proven track record of success in dealing with similar problems for similar clients using their wealth of experience. This can create a self-perpetuating cycle where these firms are great because of their \"brand image\" of providing the best legal services. Often, these firms will tout how many former industry thought leaders or experts they have as partners in the firm. \n\nAs a new associate, you likely are not a former Rockstar rainmaker on capitol hill or often asked to weigh in on legal issues on the national news. As a result, the white shoe firm has a unique problem, how do they justify charging \\[*insert a Fortune 500 Company's name here*\\] $1,000 an hour for you to do doc review? Answer: you either need to be a known expert or be capable of quickly becoming an expert. As a result, the pedigree of the associate is incredibly important in maintaining the brand image of being the best. In this pursuit, these firms often employ highly selective hiring practices such as only hiring editors of law journals, those graduating in the top percentile of their class, or only graduates from Harvard, Yale, Stanford, etc. Often, it is not lost on many of these firms that other individuals could do the job with some training--instead the hiring practices are derived from a need to maintain their image as being the 'very best.' Or, as these firms might explain: \"ability to absorb and analyze information, consider it from different perspectives, and articulate one\u2019s views cogently. It predicts that someone can learn quickly from experiences with senior partners and clients and develop judgment that he or she can apply.\" Absent being blessed with such a strong resume early in one's career, the best way to enter these firms is to become an expert the hard way--by actually doing it. Senior roles in government and industry can lead to tenure at these firms. Remember the goal is to show that you are capable of becoming some sage advisor who's knowledge cannot be found elsewhere (especially those mid market firms). \n\n**4) The Boutique Practice.** The Boutique practice focuses on a unique and difficult problem for the client. Boutique Practices come and all different shapes and sizes from the Patent mogul Fish & Richardson to more humble practices such as those attorneys that practice maritime salvage law in coastal states or even certain tax practices. Another good example is Wachtel Lipton, \"famed for its cutting-edge work for businesses fighting hostile takeover bids.\" The secret to successful Boutique practices is for them to work on the problem that is difficult/unique enough (or annoying enough) that other firms have difficulty competing in these markets. Boutique practices often form economic moats by finding a niche that allows them to hire all of the expertise, or by tackling a problem that other firms would be ill-suited to perform. Patent law is a great example of this as patent prosecution is typically a loss-leader at midmarket and white shoe firms but can be made profitable by hiring the right attorneys and support staff who can conduct the work efficiently. Indeed, there are many parallels between the commodity practice and the boutique practice--the primary differences are that the Boutique practices focus on the subjects that are traditionally difficult for 'normal' lawyers or law firms to handle. \n\nMany successful associates in the practices have strengths in the niche field the boutique occupies. For example, if the firm is a boutique tax practice, having a accounting degree, CPA, or tax LLM can be advantageous in getting your foot in the door. For patent law, having an engineering degree or a PhD in the sciences is not uncommon. These firms value individuals who have extraordinary abilities and are not in the business of \"teaching\" associates on how to do their jobs. Often these firms are smaller which makes it difficult to hide and many have \"sink or swim\" mentalities where only the truly competent survive. (This is another example where Boutiques differ from commodity practices and white shoe firms as such firms are more receptive to training individuals to practice law \"their way.\") Those looking to enter the Boutique practice should attempt to cultivate and demonstrate experience and expertise (ideally before even starting law school). However, all is not lost if you have not completed your second PhD and CPA before starting law school. Boutique practices, after all, care less about pedigree and more about your actual skills (especially those learned after working for a firm for 1-5 years). Developing your skills in a midmarket or commodity firm is the pathway in gaining actual experience need to be useful to these Boutique practices. \n\n**Concluding Remarks.** It should be said that many firms, and even different divisions within firms, can fall on different places in the spectrum. For example, many mid-market and white shoe firms have internal boutique divisions (such as tax law or patent prosecution) that can operate very different then the parent firm. Law schools (especially those not at the very top), typically do a very poor job in finding placements for law students. As a result, many schools do the bare minimum: ranking the students based on GPA so that a white-shoe firm can pick an prospective associate from the top percentile who has pulse and is able to say \"I accept\" to an $200K+ starting salary. The Mid Markets then will have sloppy seconds with the leftovers who didn\u2019t get their\u00a0\\* \\* **heavy-air-quotes \\* \\***\u00a0**\"**BigLaw**\"** offers by promising a lucrative career as a 'partner' (to a select few) after putting in 8-10 years of hard labor. The weird students who enjoy tax law or have the gumption to take the Patent bar will toil away at moving up the competency ladder of the boutique practice, and finally, the ones with mediocre grades no offers/options post-graduation will take their state bar, put in their time working for minimum wage at a commodity practice.... only to make more money then all of the classmates combined after starting their own firm to become the next [Jim Adler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Adler) or Thomas J Henry throwing a [$6 million dollar birthday party](https://setexasrecord.com/stories/510700287-a-look-at-the-plaintiff-s-attorney-who-threw-his-daughter-a-6m-quinceanera) for your kid. \n\nThe point is that your career is what you make it, and at the end of the day, the judge could care less what your grades were. Grades do not make effective advocates...advocacy does. On the same token, some of the best lawyers I have seen are not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination--the business of advocacy is often very far removed from the actual practice. The wealthy attornies are the ones who figure out how to do both the business side as well as the advocacy. At the end of the day, gaining experience should be the primary goal of any new lawyer (after passing the bar of course). Never fall for the trap of thinking that you owe a law firm anything, because I could assure you that if we had to choose between keeping you on the payroll in times of financial need or making some nice additions to our wine collection, we will take the latter every time. It isn't anything personal, but the point of associates is to make the firm more money.\n\n Be creative with your job applications. Figure out how the firm's business model works and model yourself to making you the perfect associate. Do you have a community practice that seems to do work for a cause that you find very important? Well, be sure to highlight how much you inherently care about the issue and are motivated to work on it even if it means making minimum wage. Do you have your heart set on the mid-market? Well, be sure to show your willingness to make work your entire life and do put any hobbies down on your resume which might be seen as a distraction. Is this advice cynical? Yes... Yes it is. However, I have seen so many interviews where law students seem to just not understand what firms really want. Partners do not want to hire some 'cool guy or gal' to hang out with after work. They are making an investment, and they want to hire the person that will provide them with the best return for the lowest risk. As a result, show the partners that you will make their lives easier by doing the jobs that they want you to do (in the way they want it done).\n\n Personally, I would not despair, your attractiveness as an applicant will only increase with your bar passage. In addition, lots of firms refrain from hiring until the spring. I know it is discouraging, but just keep applying. I had classmates that made it a game to see who could get the most unhinged or backhandedly insulting rejection letters. For the majority of use, the rejections are a rite of passage, and you are in good company. Anyway, I hope at least some of this was helpful and I wish you best of luck in your final year of law school and on the Bar! \n\nSource: [What Professional Service Firms Must Do to Thrive (hbr.org)](https://hbr.org/2021/03/what-professional-service-firms-must-do-to-thrive)"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Local Guide to Prolotherapy Doctors Near Me: How to Pick the Right Expert", "content": "https://preview.redd.it/p1pmuetgwkxd1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d4588ed85ac7f1de25f465399aa739f6b7edc94\n\nWhen it comes to addressing chronic pain and musculoskeletal issues, prolotherapy has emerged as a trusted treatment option for many people. This regenerative therapy, also known as proliferation therapy, involves injecting a solution, usually dextrose-based, into an injured or weakened joint or tissue. The goal is to stimulate the body's natural healing process and promote tissue repair. With its growing popularity, more and more people are searching for the right prolotherapy doctor to help them regain comfort and mobility.\n\nFinding the right prolotherapy doctor can be challenging, especially with so many practitioners offering various forms of regenerative medicine. To get the best possible care, it is crucial to know how to evaluate your options and choose the professional best suited to your needs. This comprehensive guide will help you navigate the process, from understanding prolotherapy to evaluating potential doctors, so you can make the most informed decision possible.\n\n# What Is Prolotherapy?\n\nProlotherapy is a minimally invasive treatment that aims to relieve chronic pain and strengthen weakened joints, tendons, and ligaments. The procedure involves injecting a solution, often made from a combination of dextrose and anesthetics, directly into the area of pain or weakness. This solution acts as an irritant, prompting the body's natural healing response and increasing the production of collagen, which helps strengthen the affected tissues.\n\nThis treatment has gained popularity as a promising alternative to more invasive interventions like surgery or long-term reliance on pain medications. Prolotherapy is most commonly used to treat conditions such as osteoarthritis, back pain, tendon injuries, ligament sprains, and other joint-related issues.\n\n# Why Consider Prolotherapy?\n\nIf you've been dealing with persistent pain that doesn't respond well to traditional approaches like physical therapy or medications, prolotherapy could be worth considering. Many patients who have tried prolotherapy report a reduction in pain, increased mobility, and a better quality of life. Unlike surgery, prolotherapy has a shorter recovery period and fewer risks. Moreover, it's particularly beneficial for individuals looking to address pain in a more natural and holistic manner.\n\nWhen searching for [prolotherapy doctors near me](https://www.ultimatemedgroup.com/prolotherapy), it's important to consider several factors to ensure that you find a highly qualified professional who meets your unique needs. Selecting the right doctor for your prolotherapy treatment can make a significant difference in your outcome and overall experience.\n\n# Steps to Find the Right Prolotherapy Doctor\n\n# 1. Verify Credentials and Experience\n\nOne of the first steps in finding the right prolotherapy doctor is to verify their credentials and experience. Not all medical professionals have the specialized knowledge required to perform prolotherapy effectively. Look for doctors who have undergone specialized training in regenerative medicine, particularly prolotherapy. Additionally, board certification in pain management, orthopedic medicine, or related specialties can indicate their proficiency.\n\nConsider the doctor's experience in performing prolotherapy procedures. Those with extensive experience are more likely to achieve successful results, as they have likely encountered and overcome various challenges throughout their careers. Don't be afraid to ask about the number of prolotherapy procedures they have performed and the typical outcomes for patients with similar conditions.\n\n# 2. Consider the Doctor's Approach to Treatment\n\nA holistic and patient-centered approach to treatment can make a big difference in your experience with prolotherapy. Look for a doctor who emphasizes a personalized approach and is committed to understanding the underlying causes of your pain. This means they will assess your medical history, conduct a thorough physical examination, and recommend imaging studies if necessary.\n\nDoctors who prioritize patient education are also worth considering. They will take the time to explain the procedure, discuss expected outcomes, and help you understand any potential risks. You should feel empowered to make informed decisions about your treatment, and a good doctor will support you in this process.\n\n# 3. Evaluate Clinic Facilities and Equipment\n\nThe quality of the clinic where you receive prolotherapy can affect your overall experience and outcome. A well-equipped facility with modern technology and appropriate safety measures is essential for a successful procedure. Make sure that the clinic is clean, organized, and follows industry standards for safety and hygiene.\n\nWhen visiting a potential clinic, observe whether the staff is professional and courteous. A clinic that prioritizes patient comfort, communication, and overall experience can help make your journey to recovery as smooth as possible. Remember that your comfort matters, and a well-run clinic should reflect this.\n\n# 4. Check Patient Reviews and Testimonials\n\nReading patient reviews and testimonials can provide insight into what you can expect when choosing a particular prolotherapy doctor. Online reviews can reveal details about the doctor's expertise, the quality of care they provide, and the outcomes experienced by other patients. However, it's important to take reviews with a grain of caution\u2014look for trends rather than isolated comments to get a sense of the doctor's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nPatient testimonials are especially useful for understanding how a doctor communicates, the quality of aftercare provided, and whether patients feel supported throughout the treatment process. Reviews can often help you determine if a particular doctor's style and approach align with your own preferences.\n\n# 5. Schedule a Consultation\n\nOnce you've narrowed down your choices, scheduling an initial consultation is a critical step in the selection process. During the consultation, you will have the opportunity to ask questions and assess whether you feel comfortable with the doctor. A consultation is also a chance to discuss your specific condition and learn more about how prolotherapy can address your unique needs.\n\nDuring this meeting, observe the doctor's willingness to listen to your concerns and answer your questions thoroughly. The best prolotherapy doctors will take the time to fully understand your condition, explain the procedure, and ensure you are comfortable moving forward.\n\n# Key Questions to Ask During a Consultation\n\nWhen you meet with a prolotherapy doctor, be sure to ask the following questions to help you make an informed decision:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **What conditions do you commonly treat with prolotherapy?**\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 This will help you gauge the doctor's experience and whether they are familiar with treating your specific condition.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **How many prolotherapy procedures have you performed?**\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Experience is crucial when choosing a doctor for any medical procedure, and prolotherapy is no exception.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **What are the expected outcomes for my condition?**\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 A good doctor will provide realistic expectations about the potential results and discuss the anticipated timeline for improvement.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **What should I do to prepare for the treatment?**\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Understanding how to prepare for the procedure can help ensure the best possible results.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **What does the recovery process involve?**\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Make sure you understand any aftercare instructions, activity restrictions, and the potential timeline for recovery.\n\n# Understanding the Cost of Prolotherapy\n\nProlotherapy is often considered an out-of-pocket expense, as many insurance providers do not cover it. Costs can vary significantly based on factors such as the doctor's experience, the location of the clinic, and the number of sessions needed. Make sure to discuss pricing during your consultation and understand what is included in the overall cost.\n\nWhile prolotherapy can seem like a financial commitment, many patients consider it a worthwhile investment in their health, particularly if it means avoiding more invasive treatments like surgery. Ask your doctor if there are any financing options available or if they offer payment plans to make the treatment more affordable.\n\n# Benefits of Choosing the Right Prolotherapy Doctor\n\nSelecting the right prolotherapy doctor can make a significant difference in your treatment experience and outcomes. A skilled and experienced practitioner can:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Reduce the Risk of Complications:** With a knowledgeable doctor, you can minimize the risk of complications during and after the procedure.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Enhance Treatment Effectiveness:** Properly administered prolotherapy injections can yield better results, especially when performed by an experienced professional.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Provide Ongoing Support:** Chronic pain can be challenging, and ongoing support from a compassionate and dedicated doctor can make a big difference in your recovery journey.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Tailor the Treatment to Your Needs:** The best prolotherapy doctors understand that every patient is unique and will customize the treatment to address your specific condition and health goals.\n\n# Post-Prolotherapy Care and Recovery Tips\n\nAfter undergoing prolotherapy, following your doctor's instructions carefully can improve your chances of a successful outcome. Here are some general recovery tips to keep in mind:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Rest the Treated Area:** While prolotherapy involves minimal downtime, it's important to rest the treated area to allow for proper healing. Avoid strenuous activities that could put additional stress on the joint or tissue.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Stay Active (Moderately):** Though rest is crucial, gentle activities such as walking or light stretching can help improve circulation and support recovery. Your doctor will guide you on the types of activities that are safe for your specific situation.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Maintain a Healthy Diet:** Eating a well-balanced diet rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals can help support the body's healing process. Nutrient-rich foods, particularly those high in collagen-promoting nutrients, can be especially beneficial.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Follow Recommended Pain Management:** Some patients may experience mild discomfort following prolotherapy, and your doctor may recommend over-the-counter pain relievers. Avoid anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or aspirin, as they can interfere with the body's healing response.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Attend Follow-Up Appointments:** Following up with your doctor allows them to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Consistent communication with your prolotherapy doctor is key to achieving the best possible outcome.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nProlotherapy has gained recognition as an effective treatment for chronic musculoskeletal pain and can be a game-changer for many individuals seeking relief without invasive interventions.

In all of those movies, a flaw in Peter's character puts him in the crosshairs of a conflict. One in which he originally had little to no part in and has to clean up, whilst learning valuable lessons that would shape him into his own hero. By his last film, he lead a team of his variants then was left all alone. May had died and the only resolution to a problem, that he ultimately created, was to lose his best friend and new girlfriend. \n\n\nWhatever Spider-Man 4 does is what's gonna set the precedent moving forward for this \"college trilogy\". What scares me is that the current Knull rumors would suggest a reliance on the multiverse; something Marvel and Spider-Man need to stray away from.\n\n\nEven if he doesn't battle Knull immediately, that issue is still present and they're still pushing for a Venom team up movie. Which begs for some bigger threat, that the two could tackle together. Venom is simply too powerful. He could singlehandedly take on most of Tom Holland Peter's rogues. No amount of Vulture or Mysterio would ever warrant Venom. Then they need to exceed that in 5, with a greater threat and therefore a complimentary companion to tackle it. Just give him the black suit, we don't need anything else. Have him and Venom meet in Secret Wars\n\n\nBefore Spider-Man 4 even comes out, the main focus has been set up to be about picking up on where Peter Parker is after the spell. What does his life look like? Who's on campus, who's his co-workers, neighbors, etc? What is his relationship to crime fighting? How is he dealing with his new anonymity? How do we resolve the ending of No Way Home?\n\n\nThese need to be addressed before we can drop Spider-Man into some nonsense storyline, which would add nothing to his characterization.  It's also worth noting that, even in a street level movie, these problems can still be present. You don't want a movie that takes away the spotlight from Spider-Man's story. \n\n\nYou don't wanna squeeze too many heroes or villains into one movie because then that becomes far too convoluted. One ally per movie is perfectly acceptable. We've already gotten guys like Mac Gargan, Dmitri Smerdyakov and Aaron Davis for villains. All they would need is some higher up (such as Wilson Fisk) to give 'em gear and send 'em on their merry way. We also got the building blocks to introduce folks like Martin Li, 'cause of FEAST. \n\n\n\nThere's so much potential here, that I'm afraid is gonna get squandered, to force Spider-Man on some kind of empty cosmic adventure. I'm sick of Spider-Man stories that solely exist to milk the IP. There's still good material coming out, however this is a broader issue with the character, that only gets worse and worse with time. Editorial has played marionette with the comics for years, the new cartoon doesn't look to hold much promise, Insomniac has been slowly disappointing more and more. Sure, we got BTSV to look forward to but that's the last of those movies. What else do we got? Another garbage Sony film to look forward to? Spider-Man:Friend Gone Foe 3? I genuinely hate being a fan of this character sometimes lmao. Hickman's Ultimate Spider-Man comic is awesome, hopefully it sticks around. It's the only silver lining for him, it seems.   \n\n\n"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "The Next Drain: Exporting Potential PPOP Idols.", "content": "Was causally scrolling the net and saw that YG is looking for talent for their next idol groups, looking for Filipinos to be exact. Now that got me thinking: we\u2019re already exporting a lot of labor overseas from doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers, pati ba naman idols? Should Filipino talent go to SoKor, or stay in the Philippines and beat KPop in its own game? I have always believed that Filipino talent is world class all it needs is proper support and environment. With the indubitable success of SB19 and Bini, and all the promising acts following the trail, we can see that it is possible to have own own pop idos going toe to toe with other countries, in SEA and beyond. \n\nBut I have to be level headed here and acknowledge the shortcomings of the PPOP idol system which is in its infancy compared to KPOP. Entertainment companies like ABSCBN, while longstanding producers of amazing are admittedly new in the process as well. There is still some reliance on the KPOP idol training system which had undoubtedly produced results. And lastly, in a similar situation with lots of our OFWs, some may want to work with a stable and proven Korean company than a local one. \n\nA lot of questions indeed. What I do wish is that people stay and grow PPOP, sing in Filipino, be authentically themselves. And while we can\u2019t convince people to stay, maybe in the future Filipinos would not have to.

Meanwhile the China A50 continues to hold its ground and hint at a bounce of its own.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1zplizypkxd1.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=b56e6f0f3af2aa4e3b61ef6c007610017e94dbb2\n\n# ASX 200 futures technical analysis:\n\nA week last Tuesday, the ASX 200 saw a large sellers bar which finally broke it from its choppy range near its all-time high. Subsequent price action was a series of doji\u2019s, where the majority of their daily ranges overlapped one another at the lower end of the big seller\u2019s bar. Yet overnight price action has helped ASX 200 futures close at its highest level of the sideways range, which to me hints at another attempt higher today (even if we could then go on to see new lows on the daily chart thereafter.\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows two strong buyers bars out of the choppy range. Bulls could seek dips towards the monthly pivot point (8276) or the high-volume node of the consolidation (8245). I\u2019m not looking for any too heroic, as ultimately it looks like the ASX may have at least one more leg lower on the daily chart. But a move up to 8325 or even the weekly R1 (8350) might be achievable for a cheeky long punt.\n\nAlternatively, bears could wait to see if prices can bounce, then identify swing highs to align themselves with another leg lower oh the daily chart towards 8177, 8140 or 8100.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sxne8mh2qkxd1.png?width=1506&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c638db2b42ddc1d0f171dd082c3a0ad74f53e87\n\n  \nClick the website link below to get our exclusive Guide to index trading in Q4 2024.\n\n[https://www.forex.com/en-us/market-outlooks-2024/Q4-indices-outlook/](https://www.forex.com/en-us/market-outlooks-2024/Q4-indices-outlook/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bs61k3d8qkxd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8e7c239bd769ac7185e2aac3646f9a2ecbb4f1c\n\n# China A50 technical analysis:\n\nIt is difficult to say if or when the China A50 could bounce, but it continues to look like up could be its next notable moves. At least over the near term.\n\nThe rally from the September low to October high was nearly 50% in less than three weeks. Although the market retraced over 20% of those rapid gains over the next eight trading days. Yet the strong buyers bar at 13k and the 61.8% Fibonacci ratio provided the first clue that the retracement had found an important low. And subsequent price action has remained in a tight range in the top third of that buyers bar to suggest demand remains in place (even if a breakout is yet to occur).\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows dips towards 13,400 are being supported. Bulls could seek dips towards that level in anticipation of a move to 14,000, or the 2023 high (14,220).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxknby6bqkxd1.png?width=1506&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a8ed45292e8baa8093073006c667baf32d14e2e\n\n# Events in focus (AEDT):\n\n* 10:30 \u2013 JP unemployment, job/applications ratio\n* 13:30 \u2013 SG unemployment\n* 14:35 \u2013 JP 2-year JGB auction\n* 20:30 \u2013 UK consumer credit, money supply, mortgage approvals\n* 22:30 \u2013 US retail inventories, wholesale trade, goods trade balance\n* 01:00 \u2013 US consumer confidence (Consumer Board), job openings (JOLTS)\n* 01:30 \u2013 US GDPnow (Atlanta Fed)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nView the full\u00a0[*economic calendar*](https://www.forex.com/en-us/trading-tools/economic-calendar/)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\-- Written by Matt Simpson\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter\u00a0[u/cLeverEdge](https://twitter.com/cLeverEdge)\n\n\n\n\u00a0[https://www.forex.com/en-us/news-and-analysis/asx-200-china-a50-look-set-to-bounce-asian-open-2024-10-24/](https://www.forex.com/en-us/news-and-analysis/asx-200-china-a50-look-set-to-bounce-asian-open-2024-10-24/)\n\n  \n\n\n\u00a0The information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

I passed the OSCP exam. This is my tale.\n\n# My Background\n\nI've worked in SRE for many years at a big company, but management left me rusty. I have a strong Linux, networking, and system design background, and I can code a little. I was clueless about Windows initially.\n\n# Training Plan and Timeline\n\n* **2023 April**: I started playing around on HTB and got more and more interested in security.\n* **2023 October**: Decided OSCP was a good goal. Initially planned for two months of study, starting with HTB Academy's Penetration Tester curriculum.\n* **2023 December**: I realized my two-month plan was pure fantasy.\n* **2024 January\u2013March**: Completed PEN-200 course, 100% of the labs, and continued with HTB Academy and TJNull's list until I felt ready.\n\n# First Attempt: Zero Points?!\n\nMy exam was scheduled at the end of April, 2024. Despite an encouraging start full of attack surfaces and leaked credentials, I got nowhere. I worked for 18 of the 24 hours, but I couldn\u2019t secure a foothold. It all felt much harder than the PEN-200 labs. A crushing defeat.\n\n# Stages of Grief, New Plan\n\nI received the rejection email on May 3, 2024. Three weeks of self-pity and frustration led me to double down on fundamentals, slower enumeration, and more thorough note-taking. I shifted from hating all things Windows to appreciating the security challenges inherent in Windows and Active Directory.\n\n* **2024 June\u2013July**: Focused on Windows/AD with HTB Academy and HTB CTFs.\n* **2024 August\u2013September**: Completed  about 70 HTB/PG targets with meticulous notes, integrating TJNull\u2019s and Lainkusanagi\u2019s OSCP lists for practice.\n\n# Second Attempt: 90 Points\n\nOctober 15, 2024, was retake day.\n\n* **07:00**: Started. Within minutes I exploited a web service for an \"admin\" login on the AD set. Then I spun for a while in a SQLi rabbit hole.\n* **08:55**: Got RCE. Got PE six minutes later.\n* **11:28**: Domain Admin on AD set.\n* **11:38\u201313:52**: Owned two of the three standalone machines.\n\nThat was already 90 points in about seven hours (hooray!) but I couldn\u2019t own the final target, despite identifying several potential paths.\n\nThe final target was very similar to the most frustrating target from my first exam. I found all the same potential attack points as my first time around, but I uncovered another couple of interesting things (including credentials!) and so I figured it was only a matter of time and persistence.\n\nFor the next six hours, from about 2 PM until 8 PM, I tried breaking that final target, but I was stuck. After 8 PM I worked on a draft of the report, resetting targets and working through all of the exploits to make sure I had screenshots and that my descriptions of the exploits were correct. I finished a solid rough draft around 11:45 PM and went to sleep.\n\nI woke up, showered, drank coffee, and took one last run at the final standalone with about 90 minutes remaining. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get it, not even so much as a foothold.\n\nI ate breakfast and began my final draft of the report, which took me about three hours to finish. 50 pages! In the process of writing it, I realized an obvious attack vector I had missed, a simple thing sitting right there in a big field of rabbit holes. I had dismissed it early on because it felt like a waste of time, and yet I proceeded to burn eight solid hours on everything else but that.\n\n# Key Lessons\n\n* **Don't Fool Yourself**: I was over-relying on hints during PEN-200 labs, rationalizing that I \"would have figured it out\" to such an extent that I wasn't even consciously realizing it. Explicitly categorizing practice targets into *No Hints Needed*, *Learned Something*, or *Try Harder* helped me correct this cognitive error.\n* **Prioritize Weaknesses**: Focusing on Windows improved my performance significantly. The shift was evident when I started accidentally typing PowerShell commands on Linux boxes!\n* **Recognize Rabbit Holes**: This comes through repetition, but you'll need to realize when you've tried everything you know and consider whether the current approach is distracting you from a better one.\n\n# My OSCP Study Tracker\n\nI modified the legendary TJNull and Lainkusanagi lists into an [OSCP Study Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nzEN0G6GzneWCfs6qte6Qqv-i8cV_j6po-tFlZAOx1k/edit?usp=sharing) for easy sorting and filtering. It tracks *No Hints Needed*, *Learned Something*, and *Try Harder* results. I also added a `Released` date-field for each machine, because it was useful to know if I was attacking a machine that was six years old or a more recent one. That also allows you to use Google dorks like `before:2024-08-31` to avoid spoilers.

Think Zootopia but with regular animal shaped animals that are also quite a bit more technologically advanced. One of their main forms of transportation is the hovercraft; which is used both for local urban transportation, hopping from point to point within their lush forest cities; as well as long haul and intercity transport. These hovercrafts employ a high degree of automation, and air traffic control is generally done not with radio calls back and fourth between the pilot and controller like in our aviation network, but by having the hovercraft connect directly to a dispatch server to receive instructions, which are then displayed to the pilot. This makes the aviation network more efficient as a central air traffic control node can precisely coordinate hovercraft movements to make the most use out of the infrastructure. However, due to their reliance on the computerized system, a security vulnerability in said system would be disastrous. \n\nThe following is an article from the Feline Ministry of Security, detailing a recently patched 0-day vulnerability found in an air traffic control protocol used the Feline hovercraft network. Imagine a bunch of developers who are literal cats scrambling to fix this issue the instant it was discovered before someone hacks their hovercraft network and starts remotely taking control of their hovercrafts to crash into trees that have buildings in them, crash into flocks of birds, and other woodland creature acts of terrorism.\n\n# CVE109-10028FL: DispatchToElsewhere, a memory corruption vulnerability in FDTMS resulting in remote code execution on Feline Ministry of Transportation hovercrafts\n\nThis article pertains to the public disclosure of a now patched security vulrnability in the aircraft-side implementation of Flight Dispatch and Traffic Management System (FDTMS) developed by the Feline Ministry of Transportation (FMT). This vulnerability affected all hovercrafts operated by the Feline Ministry of Transportation, and resulted in arbitrary code execution in the primary flight computers of FMT hovercrafts.\n\nThe Flight Dispatch and Traffic Management System is an air traffic control protocol that allows advanced coordination of hovercraft operations within Feline Territory. The codebase for the system is extensive, but for the purposes of this article, we will only focus on the problem component: the buildDispatchTable function which is responsible for parsing a digital flight plan into a table of procedures that the onboard computer will follow during the flight. \n\nWhen a flight plan is transmitted to the hovercraft, buildDispatchTable is invoked. As its name suggests, it parses the flight plan data to construct an Dispatch Table in the onboard computer's memory, which contains navigation information that is to be followed during the flight.  A typical dispatch table is shown below for a flight between Moonpeak Airport (MPK) in Feline Territory to Central Valley Airport (CVY) in the Unified Territories. The fact that this fight crosses a territorial boundary is relevant to the vulrnability.\n\n\n\nEntryID | EntryType | Name | SetAttributes | Location | EstimatedTime\n-------|---------|----|-------------|--------|-------------\n0 | DispatchStart | FMT1002 | flightID=FMT1002; radioID=FMT1002; origin=MPK; originLandingPadID=2; dest=CVY; startingTerritory=FelineTerritory; startingRegion=MoonDistrict; atcServerURL=fdtms://transportation.feline.gov/atc/MoonDistrict; serviceType=Commuter  | (-130.993234, -47.997826) | 12:00:00\n1 | FlightStart | MPKL2 | departureCorridorID=39; speed=100 | (-130.993234, -47.997826) | 12:00:00\n2 | WayPoint/DepartureCorridorExitPoint | MPK927 | heading=305.1; speed=300; alt=1000 | (-131.017368, -47.997826) | 12:02:00\n3 | RegionChange | AlderDistrict | atcServerURL=fdtms://transportation.feline.gov/atc/AlderDistrict | (-130.994368, -47.997826) | 12:19:13\n4 | WayPoint | ALD103 | heading=305.1; speed=1000; alt=1700 | (-129.083812, -47.997826) | 12:21:02\n5 | TerritoryChange | UnifiedTerritories/FeatherDistrict | atcServerURL=fdtms://transportation.ut.gov/atc/alternateProtocols/Feline/FDTMS/region/FeatherDistrict | (-131.001929, -48.725192) | 12:45:51\n6 | WayPoint | FET972 | heading=307.9; speed=1000; alt=1700 | (124.138493, -47.997826) | 13:00:05\n7 | RegionChange | CommonDistrict | atcServerURL=fdtms://transportation.ut.gov/atc/alternateProtocols/Feline/FDTMS/region/CommonDistrict | (-122.904928, -46.203840) | 13:37:19\n8 | Waypoint/ApproachCorridorEntryPoint | CVY671 | approachTo=CVY; requestApproachCorridorID=81; requestLandingPadID=9; defaultAction=HoverInPlace/Wait; triggerNextEntry=OnAtcAuthorization | (-122.301937, -44.927394) | 13:41:32\n9 | ApproachStart | CVYL9 | approachCorridor=81; targetLandingPad=9 | (-122.904928, -46.203840) | 13:45:00\n10 | ApproachEnd | CVYL9 | | (-122.804221, -46.103840) | 13:50:00\n11 | FlightEnd | FMT1002 | | (-122.804221, -46.103840) | 13:50:00\n11 | DispatchEnd | FMT1002 | clear all | (-122.804221, -46.103840) | 13:50:00\n\nAs shown in the table, when the hovercraft crosses an internal boundary within a given territory, a RegionChange entry is used. However, when the hovercraft crosses a territorial region, which also necessitates a region change, the standard perscribes that only the TerritoryChange entry is needed, and the region name included within it. However, it is also possible to omit the region name in the TerritoryChange entry, and separately issue a RegionChange.\n\nThe buildDispatchTable function did not take into account the possibility of a region change being separately supplied in the case of a territory change in the way it calculated the table size and therefore how much memory to allocate for the construction of the table. Therefore, a malicious dispatch message could be crafted to overflow the table and inject machine code into memory. An outside actor spoofing radio signals on government frequencies can send a malicious dispatch message to any hovercraft in range, and because the dispatch table is constructed before the cryptographic keys of the dispatch message is checked, remote code execution can be achieved by anyone, as the exploit is accessible before the authenticity of the message is verified. A pilot would only see a \"Dispatch rejected due to key error\" message, at which point the exploit has already gone through. Additionally, the onboard computer will simply discard the malicious dispatch table and reload the previous valid dispatch table upon failing to verify its authenticity, effectively deleting evidence of the exploit's entry point. \n\nThe implications of this vulrnability is severe, as an attacker can gain remote control of the hovercraft and its flight control systems, and can issue malicious commands with fatal results. Moreover, the possibility of a Feline hovercraft being used to commit acts of terrorism in another territory significantly raises the urgency of this issue. \n\nAll hovercrafts operated by the Feline Ministry of Transportation was grounded until their flight computer software was updated to fix the vulrnability. Hovercrafts already in flight were ordered to land immediately on the nearest available pad. The vulrnability has now been patched for the entire FMT fleet."}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "The Aggressive Decoupling Policy Is a Risk We Cannot Afford Right Now ", "content": "As the world continues to recover from the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic stability remains fragile. The policies enacted by governments to overcome these challenges need to be practical, measured, and focused on the immediate needs of their populations. However, one policy that I believe has been too proactive and unnecessarily risky is the aggressive push to decouple from China.\n\nChina\u2019s economy has long been intertwined with the global economy, and for good reason. Over the past few decades, China has become the world's manufacturing powerhouse, providing efficient, large-scale production at prices that benefit consumers worldwide. As we face rising inflation, disrupted supply chains, and economic uncertainty, cutting off or reducing our dependence on China may be a step too far\u2014and too soon.\n\nAt this moment, involving China in global recovery efforts is believed the most practical and effective way to stabilize economies. China\u2019s manufacturing capabilities are vital to ensuring that goods continue to flow through existing supply chains without further disruption. The idea of decoupling from China may serve some long-term geopolitical goals, but it also creates immediate risks and uncertainties for the global economy.\n\nBuilding new supply chains in other countries or shifting production back home sounds appealing in theory, but the process is neither quick nor simple. It took decades to shift manufacturing worldwide to China, and replicating that efficiency and scale in multiple countries with different regulatory and political systems is not something that can happen overnight. In fact, trying to force this transition too quickly could lead to deflationary pressures and an even deeper global recession.\n\nChina\u2019s economic and political power is heavily dependent on its role in the global economy, and the country has undoubtedly realized that its strength relies on continued cooperation and global support. This has become clear through the massive bankruptcies and layoffs that have occurred as a result of the recent decoupling efforts and global economic shifts. These realities have sent a powerful message to China that its ambitions must be tempered by the need to maintain strong economic ties with the rest of the world.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to push this policy to the point of economic self-harm. China has learned that its influence is not invincible, and further aggressive decoupling could create unnecessary instability, not just for them but for all of us. The strategic goals of reducing reliance on China can still be achieved over time, but now is not the moment to prioritize long-term ambitions at the expense of immediate economic recovery.\n\nAs a voter, I am deeply concerned about the current government\u2019s willingness to sacrifice the public's immediate needs for long-term goals. This goes against the fundamental principles of democracy, where governments are meant to serve the people, not pursue risky policies without considering the short-term impacts.\n\nInflation is already making it difficult for middle- and lower-income households to get by, and forcing supply chains to move away from China will only increase costs further. We must ask ourselves: Is this the right time to create additional economic uncertainty when people are already struggling?\n\nI believe that a more balanced approach is needed. Rather than aggressively decoupling from China, we should be working to ensure that global supply chains remain intact while slowly diversifying our manufacturing capabilities. This would allow for economic recovery in the short term while still addressing strategic concerns in the long run.\n\nGovernments need to reassess their strategies and recognize that the decoupling policy is too proactive and not necessary right now. The global economy is still reeling from the pandemic, and further destabilizing supply chains with rushed policies will only prolong the recovery process. There\u2019s a time for strategic maneuvering, but that time is not now.\n\nI call on the government to reconsider their approach and focus on what the public needs now\u2014economic recovery, stability, and pragmatic solutions to inflation and supply chain issues.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that true leadership is about balancing long-term vision with short-term realities. The public deserves policies that provide relief, not further hardship.\n"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "[Week 13] Community Currency Subreddit Analysis", "content": "[Week 13](https://preview.redd.it/vvvq3jsyujxd1.png?width=1423&format=png&auto=webp&s=7679568f0dce9899f9a8f487b818a5f0564c8057)\n\n[Week 12](https://preview.redd.it/axil8syzujxd1.png?width=1675&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb4b79c6bf836bd31695413152978a86134c9e2d)\n\nHello all, welcome to week 13 of the community currency analysis!\n\nThe past week has had more variety between the subs than usual. Personally I see that as a positive as it indicates distinct communities in subs and that means individual subs are less reliant on the activity across the community subs as a whole. This de-coupling is probably in part due to multiple bots on the scene, by having activity on each sub that isn't reliant on any other we can trust that the space as a whole is becoming more robust. \n\nLet's look at individual subs:\n\n\\- r/TheNaturallyUnknown has grown by 10 subscribers from last week, total unique users grew by nearly 30% (18 users). It's been a positive week, posts increased by 25%, comments nearly as much too and tips have remained relatively stable there. Overall the sub is seeing very consistent activity, all the natural growth and quiet periods, likely in part due to the weekly competitions in addition to people being keen to show off their various forms of creativity. This week in particular it's been quite nice to see lots of people volunteering their creations, photography, drawings, mashups, it's made for a nice vibrant week.\n\n\\- r/Bucketheads has seen a lull this past week. It has grown however the number of actual unique users has more than halved, of course its just for unique users in the past week so one quiet week isn't overly significant. That said, despite the drop in users, posts have stayed relatively consistent, it's the comments where we see the real drop. I expect this means there was either an event of giveaway in the previous week.\n\n\\- r/Coneheads is the biggest sub, and closing in on 16k. I had bet it would reach it by the current week, however I am now certain it will achieve it by next analysis post. LongCauliflower has been absent so what we're seeing is the organic activity, showing Coneheads is still an active place without an unhealthy reliance on tipping. All of the activity is pretty consistent with the previous week.\n\n\\- r/PlungerPlanet is sustaining its uptick in activity! It had a resurgence a few weeks ago and we can see its kept above 60 active users which is great. Posts have fallen slightly and naturally comments fall with that however overall the activity has been stable. I'm not particularly active on that sub but seeing it sustain this activity is great!\n\nThats all for this week!\n\nI've posted last week and week so its easier for anyone who wants to be able to flick between the weeks and compare.\n\nHopefully you all find this insightful! Thanks for reading!"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Is Lowering Interest Rates the Key Factor for Economic Recovery?", "content": "The post-pandemic recovery presents a valuable opportunity for economic revival. During the pandemic, various subsidies helped maintain purchasing power for both individuals and companies. However, the current trend of decoupling from China could severely impact global supply chains, which remain heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing. While transitioning supply chains is possible, doing so too aggressively during a period of economic recovery\u2014when the world still relies on China\u2014risks exacerbating inflationary pressures.\n\nDespite any concerns about China\u2019s political system, the fact remains that the world depends on its comprehensive supply chain. This reliance might seem less than ideal, but it\u2019s a reality. The decoupling policies that are being implemented not only harm China but also create significant challenges for other economies, potentially leading to shortages and longer delivery times for key products.\n\nSome claim that China has excess production capacity, but this argument overlooks the reality that the pandemic only pressed the pause button on the economy, not on demand. Now that global demand is picking up again, supply chain disruptions are further straining economies, with delivery times for many orders extending up to a year.\n\nThough central banks are lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity, this approach doesn\u2019t address the underlying supply chain issues. The global economy can\u2019t easily or quickly replace the foundational support provided by China\u2019s existing production network. Tackling inflation by simply stimulating demand without addressing supply chain disruptions is akin to treating the symptoms rather than the cause.\n\nMoreover, the impact of inflation is often misunderstood. Many people fail to grasp the true consequences of inflation on their wealth. While their bank balances might not change, the value of that money is steadily eroded. For example, what once cost $100 might now require $130, meaning that even though the nominal value remains the same, its purchasing power has decreased significantly. This kind of \u201chidden shrinkage\u201d in wealth is just as real as visible losses in stock markets, yet it\u2019s often overlooked.\n\nIt\u2019s concerning that many individuals seem unaware of this erosion of purchasing power. Some even argue that their money hasn\u2019t decreased in quantity, misunderstanding that inflation is quietly reducing the real value of their assets. While stock market prices fluctuate and are immediately visible, the slow burn of inflation is often harder to see, but it has an equally damaging effect over time.\n\nHistorically, economic missteps, such as those during the 1930s Great Depression, were often caused by a lack of timely government intervention. Although governments today are taking action, there is a risk that some of these policies are too aggressive and optimistic. We must be cautious of the long-term costs associated with such policies, as rushing through decoupling or overestimating the speed at which new supply chains can be established could lead to further economic distress.\n\nWhile some may argue that my concerns are exaggerated, I believe many experts have likely raised similar warnings. Economic policy mistakes can have far-reaching consequences, and it\u2019s often the middle class and below who bear the brunt of these costs. My hope is that the current approach will not result in irreversible damage to both global supply chains and the broader economy."}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Cardano Is Getting BTC Before USDC", "content": "With the recent integration of Bitcoin liquidity into Cardano through the BTC bridge, we're witnessing BTC arrive on our network even before USDC.

It also has near-limitless endgame potential, with damage that scales infinitely with your stats.\n\nBefore we begin, I have to make something extremely clear to all of you: This is absolutely a late-game build, bordering on end-game.  It assumes you have the license rank, schematics, skills, and stats necessary to make it work.  It also assumes you've cooked enough Neutron Flux to make up for any deficiency in your AV caused by having the equipment below.  If you try to make this with a low-level character, it will fail for reasons that will become apparent later on.  It isn't meant to make weak characters strong, it is meant to maximize the potential of characters that are already very strong.\n\nThere is a lot of groundwork to be done to make this work, and until you're in the late game and ready to start tackling really powerful foes, this build in its complete form won't work and will in fact be painfully sub-optimal and inferior to nearly all builds.  It only works in late game at high level.  This build has many \"moving parts\" to it that all have to be present and in motion for it to be effective, and low level characters simply cannot manage it.  It is a build that only works once you reach the late, so until you're strong enough, don't try to pursue it.\n\nWith all of that said, let's begin.\n\nSo, what are we making here?  Let's start with the implants.\n\nBody: High Fidelity Matter Recompositor  \nFace: Penetrating Radar  \nArms (Both): Palladium Electrodeposits  \nBack: Palladium Electrodeposits  \nHead: Palladium Electrodeposits  \nHands: Giant Hands  \nFeet: Force Modulator\n\nAlternatively, you can pull out the Back Palladium and put the Force Modulator there so you can put Anchor Spikes in your feet.  A loss of 20 Compute Power just means two spaces less range on your Radar, so it is not a major sacrifice.  Anyway, the above combo gives us the ability to teleport anywhere we can see, and the total compute power we'll be getting gives us a view of half the screen at all times, barring areas with force fields or reality distortions.  Force Modulator lets us ignore Force Fields.  Plus, we'll have the ability to wield two-handed weapons with one hand.\n\nNext, the Armor, some of which will sound weird, but it will make sense later, so just let me cook.\n\nHead: Psychodyne Helmet, modded with Coprocessor, Sturdy, and Overloaded  \nFace: Telemetric Visor, modded with Electromagnetically Shielded, Refractive, and Visored  \nBody: High Energy Thermo Cask, modded with Slender, Willowy, and Refractive.  \nArms: Precision Nanon Fingers, modded with Sturdy, Overloaded, and Refractive  \nBack: Palladium Mesh Tabard, modded with Sturdy, Overloaded, and Refractive  \nFeet: Anti-Gravity Boots, modded with Cleats, Refractive, and Electromagnetically Shielded  \nArms (1): Force Bracelet, modded with Sturdy, Overloaded, and Electromagnetically Shielded  \nArms (2): Transkinetic Thermo Cuffs, modded with Sturdy, Overloaded, and Electromagnetically Shielded\n\nSome of that sounds odd, but the Anti-Grav boots are for dealing with flying enemies exclusively, and this is a melee-focused build first and foremost, so  this is for being able to hit airborne enemies while on the surface, and to give us the ability to fly over ground hazards in the overworld.  The Overloaded Precision Nanon Fingers gives us a major boost to crit rate.  High Energy Thermo Cask gives elemental resistance, which this build largely lacks.  Force Bracelet is a panic button, in case you find yourself teleporting into a bad situation you weren't ready for, and can be used to keep away low level enemies if you're in an area where fighting gives zero experience.  The Telemetric Visor lets us identify loot automatically.  Transkinetic Cuffs keeps you at room temperature, so you don't get frozen or ignited easily, and helps mitigate heat generation from our Overloaded gear.  You're free to swap out the Force Bracelet and Transkinetic Cuffs for other Arm items you might find useful, but I prefer those, since they can cover for most of the weaknesses the build might have.  You could even get a VISAGE so you can have a scouter.\n\nNext, the weapons:  \nMissile Weapons: For missile weapons, you can have what you want, since we will not be using them often.  Personally, I dual-wield Grenade Launchers, with Normality or EMP grenades, or if I'm in really dangerous territory, load them with Phase Conjugate Hand-E-Nukes, so I can pop a Shade Oil, drop out of reality, and then double-nuke everything in the area to be sure nothing is left.  Just don't do it somewhere there's loot you'll want to get.  However, if you find a relic gun that has a powerful buff like +4 to Strength of Ego, you can use that instead.  Also, a Psychal Fleshgun isn't bad either, given circumstances we're about to discuss.  However, this build is melee focused, and all our implants were geared around maximizing our melee potential, though it might not seem that way right now.\n\nMelee Weapon: Dual wielding Fists of the Ape God.  Yes, this is why I said you can't make this work until late game.  Two of these bad boys will have a total weight of 300, so until you've got a lot of strength, you can't even lift these two without being over-encumbered.  There's no point in having these until you're buff enough to actually carry them plus all your other equipment.  Plus, given the nature of these weapons, they won't be that effective until you are strong enough to carry them.\n\nYou're probably asking, \"Why not Crysteel Hand Bones, it has higher base damage than the Fist of the Ape God and is lighter, isn't it better?\"  Well, that's a fair question.  The reasons are two-fold.  First off, that's another 8 license points on a build already kinda hefty on the cybernetic license, and unlike many high level implants, Crysteel Hand Bones can be hard to find sometimes without a Legendary Gutsmonger, which is never guaranteed, but there will always be an Ape God in every playthrough.  The second is that the Ape God's Fists give a +4 Ego bonus, each, which synergizes with the final ingredient of the build.\n\nThat's right, there's one final ingredient that will elevate this build.  You might have already guessed.\n\nMutation: Ego Projection.  Boost Strength.  We effectively go Super Saiyan.  Or maybe Super Ego might be a better term for it.  This raises the power of the build to incredible heights, and since the Fists of the Ape God have no ceiling to their strength bonus, there is no limit to how strong your punches will becomes.\n\nYeah, punches.  I imagine that a Truekin with a Giant Hands implant just wields these fists like a massive pair or Hulk Hands.\n\nWe're chugging Brain Brine and popping Sphinx Salt and Eater Nectar until we get this one.  We only want one.  We only need one.  This one mutation is what gives our melee build unimaginable strength, and the total +8 Ego from the Fists of the Ape God make up for any difference in base damage we'd have from Crysteel Hand Bones.  If you want other mental mutations, knock yourself out, but this is the only one you need to complete this build.\n\nSo, you can fly, sense enemies at long distances, turn Super Saiyan, teleport to be directly in the face of those enemies, and then punch them super hard with the fists of a giant ape.  Oh, and you'll likely have enough Glimmer in late game to draw in stronger opponents that you can defeat to get even stronger.  Do I need to explain why I call this the \"Goku\" build?  Admittedly, given its reliance on Ego, maybe Vegeta is a better fit?\n\nAnyway, I used a Priest of All Suns as a start so I could use the tattoo gun to give him blonde spiky \"hair\", but feel free to use any start you want that can get you to late game.  If you really, really want to make this build stupidly strong, go Dominate Saad Amus and use him as your base, since he has such massive elemental resistances and this build on a baseline Truekin is limited on that front.\n\nAnyway, have fun with this.  I certainly had fun making it and testing it.  Live and drink, water-sibs.\n\nEdit: Added the Head cybernetic implant, accidentally left that out."}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": " The Future of Data Centers: Why liquid Cooling is Becoming Essential for High-Performance and Sustainability", "content": "Hello, friends! I wrote a short piece about a new technology being used in data centers. English is my second language, so I used GPT to help with the translation...\n\nThe components and chips in data centers, especially newer, high-performance chips like NVIDIA\u2019s latest models, generate intense heat due to their processing power. Traditional cooling methods, primarily using fans, are becoming insufficient to handle these new temperature demands. As data centers grow and require more powerful chips, they will need more effective cooling solutions.\n\nLiquid cooling is emerging as the alternative to air cooling, as it can handle the higher heat generated by advanced chips more efficiently. This method transfers heat more effectively by circulating a liquid coolant directly over the chips, reducing the energy and water required to cool the data center while allowing for higher-density computing. Liquid cooling technology is expected to become the standard in high-performance data centers as it provides a more sustainable and scalable cooling solution.\n\nThere are many liquid cooling technologies out there, but here I\u2019ll focus on\u00a0**Direct-to-Chip**\u00a0cooling.\n\nAdvanced cooling methods, particularly direct-to-chip liquid cooling, offer data centers major economic benefits in the long term. Here\u2019s a simplified look at the advantages:\n\n1. **Cost Savings on Energy and Water**: Though initial setup costs for direct-to-chip cooling can be high, the long-term savings in energy and water consumption are substantial. By reducing facility power needs by up to 18%, direct-to-chip cooling can cut energy expenses by about 10%. Additionally, water use can drop by 20-90%, which is especially beneficial in regions facing water scarcity.\n2. **Support for High-Density Computing**: Direct-to-chip cooling can handle very high power densities, supporting up to 100 kW per rack compared to 15-25 kW with traditional air cooling. This increased density allows for more computing power in the same physical space, potentially lowering real estate costs.\n3. **Reduced Facility-Wide AC Needs**: These systems reduce the reliance on extensive air conditioning setups, which cuts down on HVAC costs and maintenance.\n4. **Extended Hardware Lifespan and Improved Efficiency**: By keeping equipment at stable temperatures, direct-to-chip cooling minimizes thermal stress, which can lead to fewer failures and better hardware durability. This contributes to consistent operational efficiency and scalability, making this technology increasingly appealing to data centers.\n\nWhile exact savings vary, large data centers can expect return on investment (ROI) within 2-3 years, with potential savings running into millions over a 5-10 year period as these cooling technologies improve and become more mainstream.\n\nThe booming demand for sustainable cooling is driving rapid growth in the data center liquid cooling market, projected to expand from $0.6 billion in 2023 to $3.5 billion by 2028. As resources like water become limited, advanced cooling technologies are shifting from optional to essential, emphasizing the need for eco-responsible operations alongside computing power.\n\nThere are several companies in this market, such as Schneider Electric and Vertiv.

By 2024, he was managing three servers, one of which stood out from the rest: SCPRP. This server was overseen by an independent management team that had its own plans and ideas. The main administrator of this mode was a person known as Dr. House, who introduced directives and plans, coordinating what new content to add, change, or remove.\n\nHouse handpicked the rest of the management team, which included:\n\n* Rastenxxx\n* Panda\n* Squidthley\n* And later, Troy\n\nHe also created a development team consisting of \u201cMexicoGuy\u201d as Lead Developer and \u201cDarkness\u201d as a junior developer. Eventually, two new members joined: \u201cTroy,\u201d also known as Frestylek, and \u201cKrampi.\u201d As time went on, Troy quickly ousted Mexico from his position and took over as Lead Developer, eventually gaining a spot on the management team.\n\nAfter realizing he didn\u2019t need to lift a finger on SCPRP, with the management driving gameplay and delivering content for players, Justg decided he didn\u2019t like the direction the server was heading and found it unprofitable. He shut down the server without a word of thanks to the management, announcing the project\u2019s permanent closure.\n\nHowever, after seeing how many players were there solely for SCPRP, along with the reactions in chat, Justg swiftly changed his mind. But the old management never returned to the server. This led to a decline in server quality and a lack of new, original content.\n\nThe current state of \u201cKaktusownia\u201d servers shows that both SCPRP and DarkRP exist primarily as a way to profit from players who are there just to feel powerful in high-ranking factions, not for roleplay or fun.

Throughout the episodes we see the need to do so in order to pass the trials and regain/reclaim what was lost. To that end, we see the arc of each character\u2019s individual story turning on this reliance on and appreciation of each other. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t necessarily think that Agatha\u2019s story will be one of full redemption. I mean, it\u2019s possible, but I don\u2019t know that writers want to go in that direction, if only to not lose the fun narrative potential of Agatha as a villain. \n\nNonetheless, we are obviously seeing more humanizing elements of Agatha- the memories of Nicholas, the tenderness toward Teen/Billy, etc. With Agatha, it\u2019s always a little tricky to tell whether it is deception (although I think Billy\u2019s tarot reading was meant to point us toward Agatha\u2019s being more truthful than anticipated) or whether it\u2019s simply self-serving in the moment or towards an end.  But in that  category, I think we are indeed seeing growth towards a more magnanimous witch as this journey has progressed.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see how each of the crippling obstacles of the other witches is also part of Agatha\u2019s obstacles. Like Alice, she was living, not under a curse, but under a distorted spell. Like Jen, she was living, if not bound, still stripped of her powers. And most importantly, like Lilia, she was living without a coven, and as Lilia\u2019s maestra pointed out, a coven is necessary. \n\nNow I love the other witches, and their stories could have made series all of their own and I am happy that each gets their own episode, but ultimately this is a story about Agatha, and to that end I have been seeing the way the coven has protected Agatha all along and also how she has protected them. I\u2019ve got both thoughts and questions here.\n\nAgatha cannot be separated from the coven. We saw in Jen\u2019s trial, she needed to partake in both the blessings and the burdens. As the trials progress, yes, passing the trial means the whole coven is saved, but more specifically, it is often Agatha who is being saved, and this saves the coven/moves the coven along the road. \n\nIn fact, I would go so far as to say that it was no mistake that Lilia\u2019s bops split the memory of \u201cDon\u2019t try to save Agatha\u201d. Lilia\u2019s own story needs to unfold out of time for its purposes, but we the viewers were meant to hear \u201ctry to save Agatha\u201d while Alice was *not* meant to hear not to save her. Our cowardly lion got her courage back and was meant to save Agatha specifically. That\u2019s her tarot card image.\n\nAnd yes, Lilia saved the coven by passing her tarot trial, but at the end of the trial the danger to the coven- and how she lost her life (or as we all hope, \u201crestarted\u201d)- was the Salem Seven. But the SS were only a danger to the coven in the sense that they would become collateral damage. The SS weren\u2019t after the coven, they were after Agatha. Ultimately, Lilia was saving Agatha and her bop-redacted \u201ctry to save Agatha\u201d may well have been instructions to herself. She continued doing so in her one final (presumably incredibly significant) instruction to Agatha about hitting the deck. The trials are ending with the witches sacrificing themselves for Agatha.\n\nSo my question comes in with has this also been happening in reverse? Or at least, has Agatha been trying to do the same, albeit without success. It gets tricky because again, its hard to tell where Agatha might be being deceptive, self-serving, or just \u201cAgatha being Agatha\u201d, but I noticed several instances where I think she may have been protecting the coven. The most notable of these is when she turned on the mic/speaker system which alerted the coven to Rio\u2019s intentions. For the whole series, I just assumed this was Agatha being Agatha- a little sowing seeds of division and mayhem, a little spiteful swipe at Rio. But at this point in the journey, I am wondering if perhaps Agatha was warning the coven of the danger of Rio. \n\nAnd I do believe we are going to see Agatha choose others in her battle against Rio at the end. \n\nThoughts?"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Why is money such a weird subject?", "content": "So basically, they keep telling me how awful of a leech I am.

People exchanged these valuable metals directly for goods and services. These metals were later coined to make transactions easier, as coins did not need to be weighed each time they were used. This marked the beginning of precious metals as a preferred commodity that functioned as a medium of exchange. Today, we use fiat money, which has value because the government says it does, even though it is not backed by a physical commodity like gold.\n\nToday, fiat money is used as a money substitute. Modern money is created through debt. For example, when the government issues new bonds, it borrows money that it promises to repay with interest. This borrowed money enters the economy and is used for various government expenses. However, this means that a lot of the money in circulation is tied to debt, which needs to be managed carefully to avoid financial problems. Unlike traditional money, like gold and silver, where transactions are completed immediately, fiat money involves ongoing obligations.\n\nThe national debt is the total amount of money that the government owes to its creditors. This debt includes both the principal amount borrowed and the interest that needs to be paid on that borrowed money. When people or businesses lend money to the government by buying Treasury bonds, bills, or notes, they are essentially giving the government a loan. The government promises to pay back this loan with interest.\n\nLikewise, when you take out a mortgage, you create a debt or a promise to pay, and the bank credits your account with newly created money. Should you default on your debt, you may lose a large portion of your assets, including your house, in bankruptcy proceedings. This is why banks are very careful not to lend more than the appraised value of a house and frequently only up to 80%, unless you borrow through government-sponsored lending institutions. In such cases, you will pay an extra fee in the form of insurance to protect the lenders from losses should you default on the debt and the asset price declines in market value.\n\nThe distinction between government debt and private debt lies in what backs the debt. Private debt is backed by the assets and labor of the borrower, whereas government-created debt is not backed by any physical assets. Technically, the government cannot default on its debt because it can always create new debt to satisfy the obligations of the former debt, a process known as rolling over the debt. Private borrowers can also roll over their debt, but only up to the limit of their credit, whereas the government theoretically has no such limit.\n\nYou can help pay off the national debt by sending money to the U.S. Treasury. This money is deposited into a special account and used to reduce the overall debt. When this happens, the money is taken out of circulation, meaning it is no longer available for spending in the economy. Since the money was created from nothing, it returns to nothing. This can help lower the amount of interest the government needs to pay in the future.\n\nThe current financial system can be compared to a game of dominoes. Each piece of debt is like a domino. When one piece is affected, it can cause a chain reaction that impacts the entire system. Creating new debt is like adding another domino to the setup. If not managed well, it can lead to problems like inflation or financial instability. Remarkably, if all the debt were paid off, it would be like removing all the dominoes from the game, leaving no money in circulation.\n\nIf one domino falls, it can cause a cascade effect, where many other dominoes fall too. In the financial system, this happens when someone defaults on a debt. This default can trigger a chain reaction, affecting other borrowers and lenders. To prevent the entire system from collapsing, managers (like central banks and governments) step in to stabilize the situation. They might create new money or take other actions to replace the fallen dominoes and restore balance.\n\nWhen gold was used as money, every transaction was complete. If someone defaulted on a transaction, it had little or no effect on other transactions. However, with debt-based money, defaults can cause widespread problems. In this system, no individual bank can fail completely because they can be consolidated or bailed out by creating new \u201cdominoes.\u201d But this doesn\u2019t mean the whole system can\u2019t fail. The entire financial system can still collapse if not managed properly.\n\nThe fiat money system has inherent instability due to its reliance on debt creation. High levels of debt can become unsustainable, leading to financial crises. Additionally, since fiat money is not backed by a physical commodity, there is a risk of governments printing too much money, causing inflation or hyperinflation. Historical precedents, such as the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and the Weimar Republic, demonstrate that fiat money systems can collapse under certain conditions.\n\nThe stability of a fiat money system largely depends on effective management by central banks and governments. Policies that control inflation, manage debt levels, and maintain public confidence are crucial. Central banks, like the Federal Reserve, use tools such as interest rates and monetary policy to stabilize the economy. While the system has mechanisms to prevent collapse, such as central bank interventions and international financial cooperation, it is not immune to failure. A severe loss of confidence, mismanagement, or a major economic shock could potentially lead to a collapse. In the event of a systemic failure, it would be as if all the dominoes fall, causing widespread economic disruption."}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Meta builds AI search engine to cut Google, Bing reliance, the Information reports", "content": ""}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Schools similar to SNHU that offer an online DCJ  ", "content": "I have multiple degrees from Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) and am looking for a school to earn a Doctorate of Criminal Justice (DCJ) online.

This seemed way too high since I had been informed from a sub here that they got quoted 1,15,000 during Independence Day. Then I went to Vijay Sales and got 1,08,000 as their final price. Then I went to an LG store which gave me a higher quote of 1,10,000 and wasn\u2019t willing to budge. I thought going to LG store would be a mistake but I still went to one more and that guy gave me a much better 1,04,000 deal.

There are chinks in Wagner\u2019s armor since its mercenaries' recent defeat in northern Mali by the Tuareg separatist group, the Azawad, has exposed critical vulnerabilities. Coupled with their persistent failure to curb terrorism in the areas they control, these weaknesses offer strategic opportunities for the United States and NATO allies to counter Russia\u2019s influence on the continent.\n\n \nThrough a blend of disinformation, propaganda, and information warfare tactics inherited from the Soviet Union, Wagner mercenaries have successfully pushed French forces out of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, weakening France's ties with its former colonies in Francophone Africa. They have also sown discord between Sahelian nations and the United States, prompting the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Niger's Air Base 101, a strategic site that cost Washington $110 million to build.\n\nWagner\u2019s influence extends far beyond ousting Western powers. Unlike the West, which conditions its aid on democratic and social reforms, Wagner provides regime security to Moscow-aligned juntas, deepening their reliance on Kremlin support. In return, Russia gains access to critical resources. After a pro-Russia coup in Niger, for instance, the junta stripped French company Orano SA of its uranium mining rights, handing them over to Moscow.\n\nBy directly confronting the West on multiple fronts through Wagner, Russia has not only weakened U.S. influence but also complicated NATO\u2019s operations. For Russia, transactional partnerships are insufficient. Moscow seeks to create parallel institutions that obstruct the military activities of nations aligned with the West. For instance, following a series of successful coups in the Sahel, Moscow has bolstered the power of its allied juntas by helping them establish the Alliance of Sahel States (ASS). This alliance served as a counterweight to Western-oriented institutions like the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union, on which NATO relies for regional cooperation.\n\n\nDespite their successes, Wagner mercenaries have struggled to produce meaningful, positive outcomes on the ground. Their efforts to counter terrorist threats\u2014central to their mission and legitimacy\u2014have been notably ineffective. Since the Russian-backed military juntas outsourced security to Wagner, terrorist threats have only increased. According to a report by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the Sahel and West Africa, Burkina Faso remains at the heart of regional terrorism.\n\nThe arrival of Wagner mercenaries has also fueled the rise of jihadist groups like al-Qaeda and Jamaa\u2019t Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM) while also reigniting militant separatist movements. These factions see Russia's alignment with local governments as an existential threat. In northern Mali, for example, the Azawad Tuareg rebels have escalated their attacks, targeting both the military junta and Wagner forces. On July 25, they ambushed a convoy, killing at least twenty Wagner mercenaries.\n\n\nMoreover, the Russian presence has not brought greater prosperity to the region. Instead, the humanitarian crisis has deepened. This year, according to the International Organization for Migration, around seventeen million people in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger need humanitarian assistance and protection.\n\nFor the United States and its NATO allies, Russia's actions present an opportunity to recalibrate their approach\u2014not just to contain but actively counter Russian influence. First of all, this attempt requires a shift in the U.S. geostrategic perspective, recognizing that Russia\u2019s maneuvers extend beyond the conflict in Ukraine and signify a broader confrontation with the West.\n\nSo far, this broader perspective has been missing from the Biden administration\u2019s strategy. This is evident in its hesitance to label Wagner as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and the absence of a comprehensive military strategy to curb Russian influence beyond Eastern Europe.\n\nSecond, the United States should promote enhanced cooperation between NATO\u2019s southern members, non-major NATO allies, and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Regarding counterterrorism efforts, Washington can lead a coordinated approach to address immediate threats and offer support to Sahelian nations struggling with security challenges. Despite their current alignment with Russia, these countries are facing issues that Wagner has not resolved, making them likely to accept assistance from U.S. partners like Morocco and Turkey to combat terrorist threats.\n\nThird, the United States should deepen its engagement with African nations, particularly in the Sahel. Diplomatic visits, often underestimated, play a vital role in showcasing U.S. commitment to maintaining influence. These visits signal a readiness to build partnerships and strengthen ties. For instance, Mauritania has been on Russia's radar due to its strategic geographic location. However, consistent diplomatic NATO and U.S. engagement through the NATO Alliance's Mediterranean Dialogue\u2014of which Mauritania has been a member since 1995\u2014has contributed to the country\u2019s stability and ongoing cooperation with the West.\n\nIf the United States and its NATO allies fail to adapt their strategy and exploit the vulnerabilities of Wagner's mercenaries, they risk allowing a terrorist threat to emerge. This development could trigger a severe migration crisis that could overwhelm Europe and North African countries. \n\nMore importantly, at a time when the United States is contending with challenges in the Indo-Pacific, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, continued inaction would allow Russia, Iran, and China to expand their presence in Africa, securing strategic footholds that could further erode U.S. influence on a global scale.\n\n\n"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Did Joseph Smith attempt to sell the Book of Mormon Copyright in Canada?", "content": "The FAIR Latter-day Saints page asserts that Joseph Smith's mission to Canada was merely to secure copyright protection for the Book of Mormon, not to sell it. However, substantial evidence from primary sources and historical context suggests otherwise. Below is a detailed response to each of the main claims made by FAIR, supplemented with evidence and historical context.\u00a0\n\n# [The Revelation](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-book-1/15)\n\n\"...it Pleaseth me that Oliver Cowderey Joseph Knight Hyram Pagee & Josiah Stowel shall do my work in this thing yea even in securing the Copyright & they shall do it with an eye single to my Glory that it may be the means of bringing souls unto me Salvation through mine only Be{t\\gotten} Behold I am God I have spoken it & it is expedient in me Wherefor I say unto you that ye shall go to Kingston seeking me continually through mine only Be{t\\gotten} & if ye do this ye shall have my spirit to go with you & ye shall have an addition of all things which is expedient in me. amen & I grant unto my servent a privelige that **he may sell a copyright through you** speaking after the manner of men for the four Provinces if the People harden not their hearts against the enticeings of my spirit & my word for Behold it lieth in themselves to their condemnation &{\u25ca\\or} th{er\\eir} salvation.\"\n\n\n# 1. Claim: The Attempt Was Merely to Secure, Not Sell, the Copyright\n\n**FAIR's Position:** FAIR argues that Joseph Smith\u2019s trip to Canada was solely to secure copyright protection, not to sell the rights, and asserts that no reliable evidence suggests the intention to sell.\n\n**Response:**\n\n* **Hiram Page\u2019s Testimony Supports a Sale Attempt:** Contrary to FAIR's assertion, Hiram Page explicitly states that the mission to Canada was to sell the copyright. In a letter dated February 2, 1848, Page explicitly stated in an 1848 letter that the purpose of the Canadian mission was to sell the copyright for $8,000. He wrote:\n\n>\u201cJoseph heard that there was a chance to sell a copy right in Canada for any useful book that was used in the States. Joseph thought this would be a good opportunity to get a hand on a sum of money which was to be (after the expenses were taken out) **for the exclusive benefit of the Smith family and was to be at the disposal of Joseph**. Accordingly Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Knight, Hiram Page and Joseph Stoel were chosen (as I understand by revelation) to do the business; we were living from 30 to 100 miles apart. The necessary preparation was made (by them) in a sly manner so as to **keep Martin Harris from drawing a share of the money**. It was told me we were to go by revelation, but when we had assembled at Father Smiths, there was no revelation for us to go, but we were all anxious to get a revelation to go; and when it came we were to go to Kingston where we were to sell if they would not harden their hearts; but when we got there, there was no purchaser, neither were they authorized at Kingston to buy rights for the Provence; but little York was the place where such business had to be done. We were to get 8,000 dollars. We were treated with the best of respect by all we met with in Kingston \u2013 by the above we may learn how a revelation may be received and the person receiving it not be benefitted.\u201d (Letter, Hiram Page to William McLellin, Fishingriver, Feb. 2, 1848; spelling and punctuation standardized by Eldon Watson). Page\u2019s account is a clear, direct statement of intent to sell the copyright, rather than merely securing protection.\n\n* **Whitmer and McLellin\u2019s Independent Confirmation:** Both David Whitmer and William E. McLellin corroborated the existence of a revelation directing Joseph Smith\u2019s party to sell the copyright. According to Whitmer, \u201cWe were to get 8,000 dollars\u201d from the sale (An Address to All Believers in Christ, pp. 30-31). \n* McLellin also claimed to have read the written revelation that directed the sale; \"...Joseph had a revelation for Oliver and friends to go to Canada to get a copy-right secured in that Dominion to the Book of Mormon. It proved so false that he never would have it recorded, printed or published. I have seen and read a copy of it, so that I know it existed. So do all those connected with him at the time.\"(Early Mormon Documents, Vol. 5, p 328). These independent testimonies lend credibility to the idea that the mission was about selling, not just securing, the copyright.\n* **The Inexplicable Failure to Secure the Copyright in Canada:** If Joseph Smith\u2019s party was merely trying to secure a copyright in Canada, they should have encountered no significant obstacles. By 1830, they had already successfully secured a copyright for the Book of Mormon in the United States, which means they were familiar with the process and the necessary documentation. Copyright laws in Canada at that time were based on British copyright law, which did not have significantly different requirements from American law. If they were simply looking to secure a copyright, there would have been no reason to fail in Canada after succeeding in the U.S. This failure, however, makes more sense if their mission was to sell or license the copyright, a task that would have depended on finding a willing buyer and negotiating terms\u2014factors far more complex and uncertain than merely registering the copyright.\n* The revelation literally says, \"...I grant unto my servent a privelige that he may sell <\u200ba copyright\u200b> through you speaking after the manner of men...\"\n\n# 2. Claim: Hiram Page\u2019s Statement Is Unreliable\n\n**FAIR's Position:** FAIR attempts to dismiss Hiram Page\u2019s 1848 statement, arguing that it is unreliable due to his estrangement from the church. However, this selective skepticism stands in stark contrast to FAIR\u2019s reliance on Page\u2019s 1847 testimony of the Book of Mormon\u2019s authenticity.\n\n**Response:**\n\n* To highlight FAIR's inconsistency, consider their use of Hiram Page's 1847 letter to former apostle William E. McLellin, in which Page affirmed his unwavering belief in the Book of Mormon, even after becoming disillusioned with Joseph Smith. If Hiram Page is considered a credible witness regarding the Book of Mormon\u2014despite his later estrangement\u2014why dismiss his testimony about the attempted sale of the copyright? The selective bias in FAIR\u2019s approach reveals an inconsistency in their handling of Page\u2019s accounts, one that seems aimed at preserving a particular narrative about the Canadian mission rather than objectively analyzing the evidence.\n* **Independent Corroboration from David Whitmer and William E. McLellin:** The corroboration of Page\u2019s account by other contemporaries (such as Whitmer and McLellin) further solidifies the reliability of Page\u2019s statements. Both of these men confirmed that a revelation existed directing the sale of the copyright in Canada (Early Mormon Documents, Vol. 5, pp. 197-199, 325-328). This independent confirmation from multiple sources strengthens Page\u2019s credibility.\n\n# 3. Claim: There Was No Practical Need to Sell the Copyright\n\n**FAIR's Position:** FAIR argues that there was no practical reason to sell the copyright in Canada, asserting that Joseph Smith and his associates were not in such dire financial straits and implying that a sale would not have been lucrative\n\n**Response:**\n\n* By 1830, the printing of the Book of Mormon was at a critical juncture. Martin Harris, who had already mortgaged his farm to support the initial costs, faced increasing pressure as the funds were not sufficient to cover the full cost of printing the 5,000 copies agreed upon with Egbert B. Grandin, the Palmyra printer. The sum of $3,000, which Harris guaranteed to Grandin, was needed upfront to continue the project. However, Harris hesitated to fully mortgage his farm, leaving Joseph Smith and his followers in a dire financial situation (*History of the Church*, Vol. 1, pp. 71-72). According to David Whitmer, the reason for the mission was related to Martin Harris\u2019s financial concerns about losing his farm. Whitmer recalled that Hyrum Smith was frustrated with Harris\u2019s reluctance to sell part of his farm to fund the printing, which led to the idea of finding money through the Canadian mission (An Address to All Believers in Christ, pp. 30-31).\n* Harris\u2019s mortgage was due by February 1831, and attempts to secure funds in advance would have been critical to prevent the loss of his farm. Whitmer\u2019s recollection suggests that the Canadian sale was an attempt to reduce Harris\u2019s burden (An Address to All Believers in Christ, pp. 30-31).\n* The burden of funding the Book of Mormon\u2019s publication prompted Hyrum Smith to suggest an alternative: selling the copyright in Canada to raise the necessary funds. The copyright sale was expected to bring in approximately $8,000, which would more than cover the outstanding costs and provide a much-needed financial cushion for Joseph and his associates (An Insider's View of Mormon Origins, p. 209). The $5,000 surplus would equate to about $175,000 USD in 2024. In response to this idea, Joseph sought guidance through his seer stone, resulting in a revelation directing Oliver Cowdery, Hiram Page, and others to travel to Toronto (then referred to as Kingston) to sell the copyright (David Whitmer Interviews: A Restoration Witness, ed. Lyndon W. Cook, p. 157).\n\n# 4. Claim: No Reliable Source Indicates Joseph Smith Directed a Sale\n\n**FAIR's Position:** FAIR asserts that no reliable sources confirm that Joseph Smith himself directed an attempt to sell the copyright.\n\n**Response: Multiple Sources Confirm the Revelation:**\n\nDavid Whitmer and William E. McLellin both confirmed the existence of a revelation directing Joseph Smith\u2019s party to go to Canada to sell the copyright. McLellin stated that he had read the revelation himself and confirmed its authenticity (Early Mormon Documents, Vol. 5, pp. 325-328). Furthermore, Hiram Page\u2019s account (provided above in claim #1) provides details of the sale attempt and directly implicates Joseph Smith as the one who envisioned using the sale proceeds for his family's benefit.\n\n>*David Whitmer, An Address to All Believers in Christ, 1887, p. 30-31: \u201cJoseph looked into the hat in which he placed the stone, and received a revelation that some of the brethren should go to Toronto, Canada, and that they would sell the copyright of the Book of Mormon. Hiram Page and Oliver Cowdery went to Toronto on this mission, but they failed entirely to sell the copyright, returning without any money. Joseph was at my father\u2019s house when they returned. I was there also, and am an eye witness to these facts. Jacob Whitmer and John Whitmer were also present when Hiram Page and Oliver Cowdery returned from Canada. Well, we were all in great trouble; and we asked Joseph how it was that he had received a revelation from the Lord for some brethren to go to Toronto and sell the copyright, and the brethren had utterly failed in their undertaking. Joseph did not know how it was, so he enquired of the Lord about it, and behold the following revelation came through the stone: 'Some revelations are of God: some revelations are of men: and some revelations are of the devil.' So we see that the revelation to go to Toronto and sell the copyright was not of God, but was of the devil or of the heart of man. When a man enquires of the Lord concerning a matter, if he is deceived by his own carnal desires, and is in error, he will receive an answer according to his erring heart, but it will not be a revelation from the Lord.\u201d (*...like Polygamy and the many revelations in which God told people to give Joseph money or their property or invest in his bank?)\n\n# 5. Joseph Smith\u2019s Response to the Failed Mission:\n\nWhen the Canadian mission failed, the men involved asked Joseph Smith why the revelation had been unsuccessful. Smith responded with a new revelation, stating, **\"Some revelations are of God: some revelations are of man: and some revelations are of the devil\"** (David Whitmer Interviews: A Restoration Witness, ed. Lyndon W. Cook, p. 157). This acknowledgment by Smith implies that he had, in fact, directed the mission based on a revelation and sought to explain its failure.\n\n**Don Bradley's Claim:** Bradley argues that Joseph Smith's explanation for the failure of the mission\u2014that some revelations come from God, some from man, and some from the devil\u2014fits with Smith\u2019s later teachings about the nature of revelation (D&C 46:7). Bradley implies that Joseph\u2019s later teachings validate this explanation, suggesting that it was natural for some revelations to be influenced by non-divine sources.\n\n**Response to Don Bradley:** While Joseph Smith's later teachings indeed address the possibility that some revelations may come from sources other than God, Bradley\u2019s defense of this argument introduces significant theological and practical concerns:\n\n* **Joseph\u2019s Inability to Distinguish Revelatory Sources: If Joseph Smith, who claimed to have received the Canadian revelation through his seer stone, was unable to distinguish between divine revelation and potential deception, this raises profound questions about his overall prophetic reliability. If Smith could be deceived by human or diabolical influences when receiving a revelation as important as one involving the Book of Mormon\u2019s copyright, what does that imply about the accuracy of other revelations? The fact that Joseph couldn't discern whether the revelation came from God, man, or the devil severely undermines confidence in his ability to receive and interpret divine will. Joseph's admission introduces the unsettling possibility that other revelations\u2014some of which became foundational to the early Church (ex: Polygamy, Dark skin vs access to the Priesthood)\u2014might also have been influenced by non-divine sources.**\n\n* **How Could the Devil Use the Seer Stone to Deceive? The fact that Joseph Smith suggested the revelation might have been influenced by the devil is particularly troubling, given that the revelation came through the use of his occultic seer stone. This implies that the devil had the power to influence Joseph while he was using the very instrument through which he claimed to receive much of his divine guidance. If this was true in this case, it introduces a disturbing precedent that questions the reliability of other revelations Joseph received through the same means. The use of the seer stone was central to many early revelations, including key parts of the Book of Mormon translation process, Book of Abraham, and Doctrine & Covenants. If the seer stone could be a conduit for deception, this has serious implications for the authenticity of Joseph\u2019s entire revelatory system.**\n* Don Bradley's claim: \"*This revelation was never published, even though*\u00a0***every other revelation in the BCR\u00a0was***, suggesting, again, that this one was seen as problematic.\" This is incorrect. There were several other revelations that, like the Canadian copyright revelation, were not included in the Doctrine and Covenants. While most early revelations received by Joseph Smith were eventually published in the Book of Commandments (1833) and later editions of the Doctrine and Covenants, there were notable exceptions. These exclusions often involved revelations that were either seen as problematic, tied to failed missions (preaching to Lamanites), or later deemed irrelevant to the ongoing development of church doctrine (treasure digging activities, United World Order, etc).\n\n# Expanded response to [Don Bradley\u2019s Argument](https://www.mrm.org/attempt-to-sell-copyright) Regarding the Attempt to Secure the Copyright: A Case for an Attempted Sale\n.\n\n# The Failure of the Mission is simply a conditional revelation with conditions unfulfilled\n\n**Bradley's Claim:** Bradley downplays the failure of the mission by suggesting it was a simple case of a conditional revelation not having its conditions met. He argues that conditional revelations are common, and thus the failure of this particular revelation shouldn\u2019t have been seen as particularly faith-shaking.\n\n**Response:**  \nThe failure of the Canadian mission was much more than the failure of a conditional revelation. This mission was not a minor errand\u2014it was a direct attempt to secure financial relief for the deeply indebted early church. As highlighted earlier (see the **FAIR response**), this mission was crucial for alleviating the burden of Martin Harris, who had mortgaged his farm to finance the printing of the Book of Mormon.\n\nThe failure of the revelation was not simply a case of unmet conditions; it had real-world financial consequences that shook the faith of those involved. Hiram Page's account that the participants returned feeling \"deceived\" and \"ashamed\" (Early Mormon Documents, Vol. 5, p. 258) shows that the failure was seen as more than just a logistical error\u2014it called into question Joseph\u2019s ability to accurately receive and interpret revelation.\n\n# Why Securing the Copyright should not have failed\n\n**Bradley's Claim:** Bradley posits that if it was legally possible to secure the copyright in Kingston, then the failure could be attributed to the \u201chardening of hearts\u201d of officials. However, if securing the copyright wasn\u2019t legally possible in Kingston, Joseph\u2019s explanation\u2014that the revelation may have come from man or the devil\u2014makes sense.\n\n**Response:**  \nBradley seems to overlook Hiram's statement in his letter to William McLellin, Fishingriver, Feb. 2, 1848: \"*We were treated with the best of respect by all we met with in Kingston \u2013 by the above we may learn how a revelation may be received and the person receiving it not be benefitted.*\u201d There is no evidence to suggest \"hardened hearts\" of Kingston officials.\n\nWhile securing the copyright in Kingston was not legally possible, as Hiram Page later discovered that Little York (Toronto) was the correct location for such matters, this does not mean the revelation was inherently flawed. Rather, the logistics of the failed mission don\u2019t negate the intent of the mission itself\u2014to **sell** the copyright. Page\u2019s account clearly states that upon arriving in Kingston, they realized they were in the wrong place: \"*Neither were they authorized at Kingston to* ***buy*** *\\[copy\\]rights for the Province*\" (Early Mormon Documents, Vol. 5, p. 258).\n\nThis logistical failure does not support Bradley's claim that the conditions of the revelation were unmet, but that it was inherently problematic, with **God misdirecting where to conduct such legal transactions.** Even if it were legally possible to secure the copyright in Kingston, this does not change the fact that the mission\u2019s ultimate goal was to **sell** the foreign rights to the Book of Mormon, as evidenced by Hiram Page and David Whitmer\u2019s consistent testimonies.\n\n# Moroni\u2019s Warning: The Book of Mormon Was Not to Enrich Joseph Smith\n\nOne of the most significant aspects of the failed Canadian mission is the fact that the angel **Moroni** **had explicitly warned Joseph not to use the Book of Mormon to enrich himself.** According to early accounts, Moroni instructed Joseph that the Book of Mormon was a sacred text meant to bring souls to God, not to provide material wealth (Lucy Mack Smith, History of Joseph Smith by His Mother, p. 152). The revelation to sell the copyright in Canada, which had the express purpose of raising a significant sum of money, seems to contradict this earlier divine instruction. This tension between Moroni\u2019s warning and Joseph\u2019s later actions raises questions about whether financial desperation led to a deviation from the original spiritual intent of the Book of Mormon."}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Meta Platforms $META is developing an AI-powered search engine to reduce reliance on Google and Microsoft $MSFT Bing", "content": "According to a report by The Information.\n\n### Follow [@alertscreener](https://x.com/intent/user?screen_name=alertscreener) for more"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "Goch 2.0 | Part 7- Incoming Elections", "content": "TAKEN FROM LONGOLA TODAY (LRT) ARCHIVE\n\nELECTIONS: Multiple political larties have gathered their members today to promote themselves for the upcoming elections.

The Hobbit trilogy could have been close to as epic as the LOTR trilogy but it just didn't have the magic IMO.  It didn't feel as epic.  Trying to put my finger on why that is.  Here are some ideas.  What do you think?\n\n* The dwarves are slapstick.  I feel like LOTR had a more serious tone and the dwarves were always singing and have the equivalent of fart humor for the most part.  In LOTR there was a sense of dread and foreboding when it came to the threat of Sauron, Saruman, the Nazgul etc...\n* We aren't introduced to very many new and unique places.  Many locations are re-hashes of old locations we have been to or similar places that we have been to.  We are introduced to so many new places in the LOTR trilogy in every movie.  Just think of Fellowship - The Shire, Bree, Isengard, Rivendell, The mountain pass of Caradhras, Mines of Moria,, Lothl\u00f3rien, The Gates of Argonath.  None of the Hobbit movies come close to introducing that many cool new locations.  I will say the whole Necromancer / Gandalf subplot was great.  This was a new location with a new / powerful threat.  If only the rest of the trilogy could be at that level.\n* Over reliance on CGI.  The LOTR CGI was cleaner and blended better with the practical effects.  Some of the Hobbit CGI was overdone and fake looking IMO.\n* Messing up Logolas' character.  He went from badass hero in LOTR to a jealous boyfriend type in the Hobbit movies.\n* Pacing - The Hobbit was stretched to thin vs the source material.  LOTR was three books.  The Hobbit was one book.  Too much time spent trying to fill in the gaps so that Tolkien's work isn't there as much.\n* The villains weren't as scary.  Besides a brief encounter with the Necromancer the villains weren't as bad in The Hobbit trilogy.  Nothing was as threatening as Sauron, Saruman, the Nazgul, etc...    Azog is just big orc and Smaug talked too much IMO.  I mean after having a 20 minute conversation with Bilbo he just didn't seem as threatening.  The Great Goblin wasn't scary at all.\n\nWhat am I missing?"}}, {"platform": "Reddit", "company": "RELIANCE", "page_content": {"title": "EmailExpertAI OTO links and exclusive bonuses", "content": "EmailExpertAI ReviewEffective email marketing is paramount for businesses striving to generate leads, build targeted lists, and automate campaigns that convert.

A 10-Bagger in the Making?", "content": "\n\n**Investment Report**\n\n>\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* **Pioneering Position in UV Disinfection**: Intellego leads in a niche and growing industry, offering reliable, single-use UV dosimeters with minimal competition, especially in Europe.\n* **Strategic Vertical Integration**: Through subsidiaries Yuvio and Daro, Intellego combines disinfection machines with consumable dosimeters, strengthening its recurring revenue model and simplifying sales.\n* **Strong Growth Potential**: With expanding international presence, particularly in North America and Asia, Intellego is well-positioned to scale in a high-demand market as industry regulations and quality standards rise.\n\n\u00a0If you want to see the whole theis with the graphs and price images go to my substack:\n\n[https://open.substack.com/pub/smallcaptreasures/p/intellego-technologies-a-10-bagger?r=1od1d5&utm\\_campaign=post&utm\\_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true](https://open.substack.com/pub/smallcaptreasures/p/intellego-technologies-a-10-bagger?r=1od1d5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true)\n\n\n\n# 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction:\n\nIntellego has developed a unique and innovative technology centered around its patented photochromic ink, which changes color when exposed to various frequencies of UV light\u2014UVA, UVB, or UVC. This technology can be printed on different substrates, including dosimeter cards and adhesive labels, providing users with a simple, real-time visual indication of accumulated UV radiation. The core of Intellego\u2019s solution is not only its ability to measure UV exposure, but also its potential to help users control and optimize the use of UV light. Whether for disinfection, UV curing, or other applications like plant growth, Intellego\u2019s platform allows for easy monitoring of energy transfer, offering an efficient way to ensure that sufficient radiation has been applied. The effectiveness of this technology has been confirmed through rigorous testing by the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE).\n\nIntellego\u2019s dosimeters, which are central to their product line, are used across various industries. In healthcare, UVC dosimeters ensure that surfaces are properly disinfected by confirming that they have been exposed to enough UV radiation to neutralize harmful bacteria, viruses, and spores. These tools provide an easy and reliable solution to maintain high hygiene standards, especially in hospitals and other medical facilities. Beyond healthcare, Intellego\u2019s UV indicators are also aimed at consumers, helping individuals monitor their sun exposure and adjust their sun protection routines accordingly. The company's ongoing commercialization process for these UV indicators represents a significant step toward expanding its reach in the consumer market.\n\nOn the industrial side, Intellego\u2019s technology also plays a role in processes such as UV curing, where precise energy application is critical for achieving desired results in manufacturing, coating, or adhesive applications. The company\u2019s ability to develop and expand its photochromic ink technology for different wavelengths opens up even more potential use cases, making their solutions adaptable to new markets as they continue to evolve.\n\nFinancially, Intellego presents an attractive opportunity. With a current market capitalization of around 650 \u00a0million SEK, the company expects to close 2024 with over 300 million SEK in revenue and 110 million SEK in EBIT. This means they are trading at less than seven times EBIT, offering a compelling valuation given their strong growth trajectory. Intellego is well-positioned for the future, with existing contracts and opportunities that could potentially triple their revenue in the coming years. As the company continues to expand its reach across healthcare, consumer, and industrial sectors, its innovative technology and growth potential make it a business worth watching closely.\n\n# 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product lines:\n\nIntellego has developed an extensive range of innovative products that leverage its patented UV technology, now further enhanced by strategic acquisitions. The core of its product line is the use of photochromic ink in UV dosimeters, which change color in real time to indicate the accumulated exposure to UV radiation. These dosimeters are vital across multiple sectors, providing essential verification in processes where precise UV energy application is critical. Intellego\u2019s UV dosimeters are used in healthcare settings for surface disinfection, as well as in industrial applications like UV curing, which is commonly required in manufacturing, packaging, and medical technology.\n\nAdditionally, Intellego has ventured into the direct-to-consumer (DTC) market with its Smartsun UV wristbands and stickers. These products offer consumers an easy and effective way to monitor their sun exposure, helping them determine when to reapply sunscreen or seek shade. This segment taps into the growing trends of skincare and self-care, both of which are gaining momentum as awareness about the dangers of excessive sun exposure increases. While Intellego has not yet disclosed specific revenue figures for this segment, it represents a promising avenue for growth if marketed effectively.\n\nIntellego's recent acquisitions of Yuvio and Daro have significantly broadened its offering and market presence. Yuvio focuses on providing UVC disinfection lamps, which are primarily used in hospital settings and other high-demand hygiene environments. Daro, on the other hand, specializes in water disinfection solutions. While these products carry lower margins compared to Intellego\u2019s core offerings, they are high-ticket items that appeal to sales teams and distributors, making it easier to push these products in the market. More importantly, these acquisitions support the sales of Intellego\u2019s UV dosimeters, which are essential for the correct use of Yuvio\u2019s and Daro\u2019s equipment. The dosimeters come with an impressive margin of 95%, creating a complementary relationship between the equipment and dosimeter sales, where both are needed for effective disinfection processes.\n\nIn healthcare, Intellego\u2019s dosimeters are used to ensure that surfaces in hospitals, gyms, cinemas, and schools have been exposed to sufficient UVC radiation for proper disinfection. When used in conjunction with Yuvio\u2019s UVC disinfection lamps, the dosimeters allow users to confirm that the right amount of UV energy has been applied, thus maintaining high hygiene standards. This integration of products not only enhances disinfection processes but also strengthens Intellego\u2019s market position in the healthcare sector.\n\nOn the industrial side, Intellego's UV Assure products are used in any process where UV curing is critical, such as in the electronics industry, packaging, and the production of medical devices. By ensuring accurate UV energy application, these products help manufacturers maintain quality control and efficiency in their operations. Moreover, Intellego has also developed software solutions that integrate with its UV technology, further improving the ease of use and accuracy of its products in both healthcare and industrial settings.\n\nIntellego\u2019s potential market is vast, spanning multiple industries. UV irradiation is used in healthcare disinfection, water and food sterilization, UV curing, crop cultivation, and even consumer sun protection. Today, Intellego operates in key regions such as North America, where UVC disinfection is widespread, and Asia, where consumer use of UVC products is common. While the European market is less developed in terms of UVC disinfection, it is growing steadily. The global market for UV disinfection is significant, with around 75-100 companies conducting approximately 16 million disinfection runs per year. This equates to roughly 1.6 billion runs annually, and if Intellego\u2019s color-changing dosimeters were integrated into each process, the market potential would be substantial\u2014estimated at up to 16 billion SEK annually. While Intellego\u2019s current revenue is far from this figure, the opportunity for growth is immense as the company works to integrate its dosimeters as a standard tool in these disinfection processes.\n\nIn summary, Intellego\u2019s product lines span across healthcare disinfection, industrial UV curing, and consumer sun protection. With its high-margin dosimeters and newly acquired equipment from Yuvio and Daro, Intellego is well-positioned to capitalize on growing demand across multiple markets. The combination of high-ticket equipment sales and the complementary need for dosimeters offers a unique business model that drives both revenue growth and market expansion in healthcare, industrial, and consumer sectors.\n\n\n\n# 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competitive advantages:\n\nWhile Intellego\u2019s patented UV dosimeter technology is a valuable asset, it is not the company\u2019s primary competitive advantage. What truly sets Intellego apart is its business model and the strategic synergy created by its acquisitions of Yuvio and Daro. These subsidiaries, which provide UVC disinfection lamps and water disinfection solutions, respectively, have enhanced Intellego\u2019s competitive position by creating a recurring revenue stream tied to their core products.\n\nIntellego\u2019s UV dosimeters, though a small and inexpensive component, are critical to the effective operation of the equipment provided by Yuvio and Daro. This means that once a customer purchases or leases equipment from these subsidiaries, they will continue to need Intellego\u2019s high-margin dosimeters to ensure the correct application of UV energy. This creates a dependable source of recurring revenue, as the dosimeters are consumables that need to be regularly replenished. The fact that 70% of Intellego\u2019s revenue currently comes from existing customers speaks to the company\u2019s ability to retain clients and build long-term relationships.\n\nMoreover, Intellego\u2019s strategy of offering both equipment and consumables gives it a dual advantage. By bundling their dosimeters with Yuvio\u2019s and Daro\u2019s disinfection equipment, they make it easier for sales teams to promote the entire product line, ensuring that customers purchase both hardware and the necessary monitoring tools in one package. As Intellego continues to expand its market share and integrates its products more deeply into client workflows, switching to another provider becomes less appealing. The cost savings of switching to a cheaper dosimeter, which may cost a few cents less, are negligible compared to the operational risks or the potential liability issues that might arise if disinfection processes are compromised.\n\nThis customer reliance on Intellego\u2019s products offers the company a strong pricing power advantage. Over time, as Intellego\u2019s products become more ingrained in healthcare and industrial processes, they will have the ability to raise prices without significant pushback. Given that UV dosimeters represent a tiny fraction of a hospital\u2019s or industrial facility\u2019s overall budget, Intellego can adjust pricing upward without customers being incentivized to switch providers.\n\nIn addition, Intellego\u2019s ability to adapt its UV technology to a wide range of applications\u2014from healthcare disinfection to industrial UV curing and consumer sun protection\u2014further solidifies its market positioning. The company\u2019s technology isn\u2019t just versatile; it\u2019s crucial in industries where precision and reliability are key.\n\n# 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Acquisitions:\n\nIntellego has made several strategic acquisitions that have significantly bolstered its position in key markets and laid the groundwork for long-term growth. Among the most impactful are the acquisitions of Daro Group and Yuvio, both of which have expanded Intellego\u2019s reach and provided synergies that enhance its core offerings, particularly in UV disinfection and water treatment.\n\nThe Daro Group, acquired to strengthen Intellego\u2019s presence in the UV and specialist lighting sectors, delivered strong results in 2023. The company made substantial investments in product development and sales, setting the stage for robust growth. Daro is expected to show 15% sales growth in 2024, with even greater profit growth anticipated as its gross margins continue to improve. This success is largely attributed to Daro\u2019s increased focus on its Specialist Lighting\u2014particularly for hospitals and prisons\u2014and its UV & Water divisions.\n\nA key part of Daro\u2019s growth strategy was its acquisition of UV Light Technology Limited in early 2023. The acquisition, completed for approximately 496,902 GBP, brought in 45,000 GBP in revenue during Q1 (March only) and offers significant opportunities for future growth. In 2023, UV Light Technology had annual revenue of approximately 510,000 GBP and a profit of 82,500 GBP. This acquisition is expected to accelerate Daro\u2019s growth, particularly across the UV spectrum, including UVC disinfection and equipment sales, providing Daro with a strong foundation for both revenue and profit expansion.\n\nMeanwhile, Intellego\u2019s acquisition of Yuvio has also been a strategic move to complement its dosimeter sales. Yuvio\u2019s business model focuses on capital equipment sales, which subsequently drive recurring dosimeter sales. This approach provides Intellego with increased direct access to end users in healthcare environments, such as Infection Prevention (IPs) and Environmental Services (EVS) teams, further securing the long-term growth of Intellego\u2019s high-margin dosimeters. Yuvio has already begun executing several transactions that will be reflected in the coming quarters, and its early success may lead to further investment in this area. A notable aspect of Yuvio\u2019s business model is its focus on leasing capital equipment, which provides visible, contracted monthly cash flow over several years. This predictable revenue stream enhances Intellego\u2019s financial stability and growth outlook.\n\nThrough these acquisitions, Intellego has not only expanded its product offering but also strengthened its revenue model, balancing between high-margin consumables like UV dosimeters and capital equipment sales, which generate consistent cash flow. These moves have positioned the company for sustained growth, with a clear pathway to increase both revenue and profitability in the coming years.\n\n# 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Growth opportunities:\n\n**International Expansion**\n\nIntellego is making impressive strides in its\u00a0**international expansion**, with a focus on key markets such as\u00a0**North America**\u00a0and\u00a0**Asia**. While most of the company\u2019s revenue currently comes from Europe, Intellego is well-positioned to capitalize on its growing presence in these crucial regions. In\u00a0**North America**, where UVC disinfection has been widely used for the longest time, Intellego\u2019s dosimeters are already playing a critical role in sectors like healthcare, gyms, schools, and cinemas. As UVC disinfection becomes more prevalent across other industries, Intellego\u2019s products are expected to see continued demand.\n\nIn\u00a0**Asia**, where UVC disinfection is widespread, especially for consumer use, Intellego has established strong local partnerships with distributors. The company\u2019s strategy of forming new collaborations in this region will allow it to further penetrate these markets and secure a larger share. With UVC disinfection growing steadily in the\u00a0**European Union**, the company is poised for continued geographic expansion and revenue growth.\n\n\n\n**Asia Hospital Contract**\n\nA key milestone for Intellego\u2019s growth in\u00a0**Asia**\u00a0is its collaboration with\u00a0**Likang**, one of China\u2019s largest companies in the disinfection industry, with access to around\u00a0**3,000 hospitals**. This partnership, announced in June, provides Intellego with a strong foothold in the Chinese market and opens the door to future collaborations.\u00a0**Yuwell**, Likang\u2019s parent company, has a global reach of approximately\u00a0**300,000 healthcare institutions**, further extending Intellego\u2019s market opportunities.\n\nThe collaboration is progressing well, with Intellego and Likang focusing on existing\u00a0**dosimeters**\u00a0and exploring additional products for future cooperation. This contract highlights Intellego\u2019s ability to establish key partnerships in markets with high demand for disinfection technology, positioning the company for long-term growth.\n\n**New Market Uses**\n\nIntellego\u2019s\u00a0**technology platform**\u00a0is built around its patented color-changing photochromic ink, which is adaptable for various applications. As the company continues to develop photochromic inks for different wavelengths, the number of new market uses for Intellego\u2019s products increases. Ongoing projects in\u00a0**horticulture**\u00a0involve adapting Intellego\u2019s technology for plant cultivation, with several projects moving through the development and commercialization phases.\n\nIntellego is also focused on expanding its presence in\u00a0**UVC and UVA curing technologies**, which are widely used in industries such as printing, electronics, and medical equipment manufacturing. By optimizing these processes with its UV dosimeters, Intellego can improve efficiency and quality control in these sectors.\n\nThe company also sees potential in the\u00a0**medtech sector**, where its products help ensure proper disinfection levels in medical environments. As regulations evolve in markets such as the USA, UK, and China, Intellego\u2019s technology is well-positioned to meet stricter quality assurance requirements, driving further growth in demand for its dosimeters.\n\nAdditionally, during\u00a0**Q4**, Intellego received several larger orders and began new\u00a0**Letters of Intent (LOI)**\u00a0projects. Among these is a development project with one of the\u00a0**world\u2019s largest sports retailers**, which has the potential to generate up to\u00a0**75 million Euros over three years**\u00a0if the project successfully reaches the market. This project represents a significant growth opportunity for Intellego, and updates will be provided as more information becomes available.\n\n**Management Outlook**\n\nLooking forward, Intellego\u2019s management remains optimistic about the company\u2019s growth trajectory. Sales in the core sectors of\u00a0**disinfection and curing**\u00a0are increasing and are expected to continue their upward trend as a result of Intellego\u2019s ongoing business improvements. The\u00a0**disinfection sector**\u00a0in particular is set to benefit from new market standards and upcoming regulations, which demand higher levels of quality control for UV disinfection devices.\n\nIntellego\u2019s management has set an ambitious goal: within the next\u00a0**three to five years**, the company aims to achieve\u00a0**over 1 billion SEK in revenue**\u00a0and\u00a0**300 million SEK in EBIT**. This growth will be driven by\u00a0**geographic expansion**\u00a0and the introduction of new products tailored to evolving market needs. Intellego is also expanding its product portfolio to include\u00a0**capital equipment**\u00a0for water, air, and surface disinfection, which will further enhance its revenue base.\n\nIn 2023, Intellego invested approximately\u00a0**30 million SEK**\u00a0in its new subsidiary, which focuses on selling capital UV equipment and dosimeters. This business model is expected to generate a stable\u00a0**monthly cash flow**, with a projection of\u00a0**170 million SEK**\u00a0over the next three years. Intellego\u2019s leadership is confident that these investments, along with close customer relationships and new market opportunities, will drive the company\u2019s future growth and position Intellego as a global leader in the UV industry.\n\n# 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CEO and incentive program:\n\n**Claes Lindahl**, founder of Intellego and CEO since 2011, has been instrumental in guiding the company\u2019s growth. Born in 1984, Lindahl holds degrees in biotechnology and economics from Chalmers University of Technology and Link\u00f6ping University, and has been an active entrepreneur since 2011. His leadership has been vital in driving Intellego\u2019s innovation and market expansion, particularly impressive given the company\u2019s small size. Despite Intellego's lean management structure, with Lindahl acting as the sole executive until the appointment of a CFO in April 2024, the company consistently delivers detailed and informative quarterly reports.\n\nLindahl holds\u00a0**1,691,900 shares**\u00a0in Intellego and\u00a0**1,120,000 warrants**\u00a0issued under the\u00a0**2021/2024A incentive program**, reflecting his long-term commitment to the company. Intellego has introduced several other\u00a0**incentive programs**\u00a0to ensure strong alignment between the company\u2019s leadership and its shareholders. These programs include:\n\n* **Incentive Program 2021/2024B**: Offering 700,000 warrants to board members, with a subscription price of\u00a0**14.4 SEK**\u00a0per share, exercisable from April 29 to October 29, 2024. All these warrants have already been exercised.\n* **Incentive Program 2021/2024C**: Comprising 102,000 warrants, with a subscription price of\u00a0**25.12 SEK**\u00a0per share, exercisable from December 1 to December 15, 2024. These warrants have a higher subscription price than the share price in which the company is trading and therefore we could see those not being exercised.\n* **Incentive Program 2022/2027**: Targeted at one employee, offering 80,000 warrants with a subscription price of\u00a0**30 SEK**, exercisable from June 13 to July 13, 2027.\n* **Incentive Program 2023/2026**: Created for the newly elected chairman, Gregory Batcheller, offering 60,000 warrants with a subscription price of\u00a0**40 SEK**, exercisable from August 24 to September 7, 2026, provided the share price exceeds\u00a0**75 SEK**.\n\nI personally would prefer that the incentives were related to metrics like revenue and profits instead of only share price, but as Charlie Munger said, show me the incentives and I will show you the outcomes. As the CEO has the incentive of making the company very valuable in the long term as he is young and has significant ownership in the company.\n\nIf we take a look at insider trading, we can see that the CEO has been buying stock in his own company.\n\n# 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Valuation:\n\nIntellego\u2019s valuation is shaped by its solid financial performance and ambitious growth plans. Over the past two years, the company has achieved\u00a0**ROICs above 40%**, showcasing its ability to generate strong returns from its investments. This level of profitability is expected to continue, as Intellego expands into new markets with a current capital expenditure (CAPEX) of\u00a0**20% of revenue**. While this intensive investment phase supports rapid expansion, CAPEX spending is expected to decrease as Intellego reaches a more stable growth stage, boosting free cash flow over time.\n\nIntellego has used\u00a0**share dilution**\u00a0in the past to support growth and fund its compensation programs. Going forward, additional share issuances are anticipated both to attract and retain talent through incentive programs and to finance ongoing expansion efforts. This dilution will vary depending on Intellego\u2019s success in funding growth through internal cash flows. Although\u00a0**debt issuance**\u00a0remains a potential option, any debt taken on is not expected to significantly impact financial projections.\n\nThe following three scenarios\u2014**Bull, Base, and Bear cases**\u2014illustrate the potential range of Intellego\u2019s valuation outcomes, taking into account different growth rates, ROIC targets, and dilution expectations:\n\nIn this table you can see the main metrics that change depending on the scenario.\n\n**Bull Case**\n\nIn the Bull case, Intellego achieves its goal of\u00a0**1 billion SEK in revenue and 300 million SEK in EBIT within four years**. With margins maintained at around\u00a0**30% EBIT**, Intellego would need to sustain an ROIC of approximately\u00a0**30% over a decade**\u00a0to support this rapid growth. Limited share dilution would occur as Intellego funds most of its expansion through cash flows. In this scenario, Intellego could issue shares at valuations of\u00a0**10 to 15 times EBIT**, keeping dilution at manageable levels and maximizing shareholder value.\n\n**Base Case**\n\nIn the Base case, Intellego reaches\u00a0**1 billion SEK in revenue and less than 300 million SEK in EBIT in five years**. Here, some\u00a0**gross margin erosion**\u00a0prevents the company from fully meeting its EBIT target, though Intellego still achieves sustainable growth with moderate share dilution. An ROIC in the mid-twenties would be necessary to meet this growth rate, and dilution is projected at\u00a0**10 times EBIT**. This scenario represents a balanced outlook where Intellego encounters challenges but maintains a steady expansion trajectory.\n\n**Bear Case**\n\nIn the Bear case, Intellego faces a tougher market environment, achieving\u00a0**1 billion SEK in revenue and less than 300 million SEK in EBIT over ten years**. Increased\u00a0**gross margin erosion**\u00a0and substantial\u00a0**share dilution**\u00a0are assumed in this scenario due to the need for external funding. Intellego would need to maintain an ROIC in the\u00a0**high teens**\u00a0to support this slower growth rate. Dilution in this scenario would occur at\u00a0**8 times EBIT**, reflecting conservative valuations and potential market headwinds.\n\n\n\nAcross all scenarios, Intellego\u2019s\u00a0**average effective tax rate of 15%**\u00a0remains consistent, as does the company\u2019s potential to reach its 1 billion SEK revenue target with disciplined CAPEX and ROIC management. The projections emphasize Intellego\u2019s significant growth potential alongside the impact of dilution, which allows the company to expand while aligning leadership interests with long-term growth through share-based compensation.\n\n**Final valuation.**\n\nThe target prices were reached using a discounted cash flow model with a discount rate of 15%, I use a really high WACC to represent the high risk that we are taking into when investing in a micro small cap.\n\nWe end up with a target price of 49.68 SEK which means that we can buy the stock with a wide margin of safety.\n\n# 8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion:\n\n\u00a0Intellego Technologies presents a compelling investment opportunity as a pioneering market leader in the UV disinfection sector, a niche industry with substantial growth potential. The lack of identifiable competitors suggests either an unbranded market presence or that Intellego is breaking new ground in this field. One of the main challenges Intellego faces is establishing a sustainable model for selling its small, single-use consumables, a hurdle the company is addressing by bundling them with proprietary disinfection machines through its subsidiaries, Yuvio and Daro. This integration makes Intellego\u2019s business model both unique and scalable.\n\nWhile Intellego is still a young company and faced some initial growing pains\u2014such as delayed quarterly results, which led to a fine from its trading exchange\u2014the recent addition of a CFO indicates that these issues are being actively managed. With a solid foundation now in place, Intellego is well-positioned to expand further, providing investors with an exciting prospect in a high-growth, underserved market.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThe information provided in this article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.
